            Police removed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny from a rally in Moscow's Pushkin Square, carrying him off by his arms and legs.

            Officers used batons against protesters, with many in the crowd chanting "Putin is a thief!" and "Russia will be free!"

            Part of St Petersburg's famous avenue Nevsky Prospekt was blocked off by police as a crowd of roughly 1,000 demonstrators marched through the city.

            The country's interior ministry said about half of the 1,200 arrests happened in Moscow, but monitoring group OVD-Info put the number at more than 1,600 across 20 cities.

            Mr Putin's critics say he is more of a tsar than a democratic leader.

            Mr Navalny, who has been repeatedly detained and jailed for organising protests, published a message ahead of the marches saying: "If you think that he is not our tsar, take to the streets of your cities.

            "We will force the authorities, made up of swindlers and thieves, to reckon with the millions of citizens who did not vote for Putin."

            Mr Navalny called for rallies in more than 90 towns and cities, including   Moscow and St Petersburg.

            A Twitter account supporting Mr Navalny posted images from the protests, showing a stream of people waving Russian flags and carrying red balloons.

            The authorities regard most of the protests as illegal, arguing that their time and place was not agreed with them beforehand.

            One activist told a crowd in the city of Khabarovsk: "Putin has already been on his throne for 18 years! We've ended up in a dead end over these 18 years. I don't want to put up with this!"

            Mr Putin, 65, was re-elected in a landslide victory in March - extending his grip over the world's largest country until 2024. He will be inaugurated on Monday.

            He has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000.

            His victory makes him the longest-lasting leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, who ruled for nearly 30 years.

        text: """
            Shares in Apple, already the world's most valuable company, rose by almost 4% on Friday to more than $183.7 each.
            Mr Buffett said his Berkshire Hathaway group bought about 75 million more shares of the iPhone maker in the first three months of the year.
            His investment moves are closely watched across the world.
            Mr Buffett's company has been buying up shares in Apple since 2016. Berkshire Hathaway claimed a nearly 3.3% stake, or more than 166 million shares, at the end of last year.
            At the time, the holding, one of Berkshire's biggest stock market gambits, was worth more than $28bn.
            Now, after the additional share purchases and an 8% rise in price since the start of the year, the firm's stake is worth more than $44bn.
            Apple's market value now stands at almost $932bn.
            "It is an unbelievable company," Mr Buffett said in an interview with CNBC. "If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States."
            Some analysts have worried the technology giant's best days are behind it, as competition in the smart phone market increases and sales growth slows.
            But the company has been building up other lines of business, including the services unit that includes the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay.
            Apple this week reported profit of $13.8bn in the first three months of the year, rising 25% from the same period in 2017.
            The company also has a generous share buyback and dividend programme that is expanding.
            Apple, citing new US tax cuts, this week said it would buy back $100bn worth of shares and increase its dividend.
            The moves, which return money to its shareholders, had been widely anticipated in the aftermath of the new tax law, which lowered the corporate tax rate and reduced the incentives for firms to hoard cash overseas.
            Berkshire Hathaway will host its annual meeting for shareholders in Omaha, Nebraska this weekend.

            "I accept the consequences of this vote and will tender my resignation to the boards of Air France and Air France-KLM in coming days," he said.
            In a ballot, 55% of the French employees rejected the deal.
            Air France-KLM - one of Europe's biggest airlines - has seen a series of strikes in recent weeks.
            The industrial action has cost the Franco-Dutch alliance millions of euros.
            In the ballot, company employees rejected a 7% pay rise over the next four years.
            They have been demanding a 5.1% increase in 2018 instead - in a dispute that began in February.

            "This is an enormous mess that will only put a smile on the faces of our competitors," Mr Janaillac told a news conference.
            He said he hoped his departure would spark "a more acute collective awareness" before leaving without taking questions.
            The 65-year-old chief executive, who had been in the job for less than two years, earlier promised to quit if the pay deal was rejected.
            He had been trying to cut costs at the company, amid rising competition from low-cost airlines and Gulf national carriers.
            He will officially resign next Wednesday, Air France-KLM said.
            'Pain'
            Meanwhile, the company's unions said further strikes would be staged in the coming days.
            Air France-KLM has already downgraded its profit and growth expectations for 2018.
            Air France and KLM merged in 2004. They transport tens of millions of passengers around the world every year.
            Labour reforms launched by French President Emmanuel Macron have also led to strikes by employees of the state-owned SNCF rail company.
            British Airways and Lufthansa have already undergone deep cost-cutting in recent years, and some analysts say Air France has lagged behind.
            "There is inevitably some pain for staff when structural changes are made, but once that is dealt with, you're left with a much healthier company," said aviation consultant John Strickland.
            "That has been proved in the cases of the turnarounds achieved by Iberia and British Airways."

        category: .science,
        preview: "Astronauts hoping stay on the moon for long-term missions have another reason to worry about moon dust: It could be quite harmful if inhaled, as demonstrated in a new study.",
        text: """
            We’ve long known that moon dust could cause trouble. During the Apollo missions, astronauts complained of sneezing and watery eyes after tracking dust from their spacesuits back into their ships. Scientists need to take moon dust and rocks into account when designing lunar landing equipment because it sticks to everything.

            No mice or humans were sent to the moon for this new study. Instead, scientists grew both human cells and mouse cells in the lab and exposed both to a simulated lunar dust. In both cases, the moon dust could kill the cell or damage the cells’ DNA.

            “Very small particles in the breathable range or smaller can interact directly with cells,” study author Bruce Demple, a professor at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine, told Gizmodo.

            Moon dust isn’t like Earth dust. Without weather or an atmosphere, the lunar soil is dry and potentially electrostatically charged, according to the paper published last month in GeoHealth. And billions of years of bombardment from meteorites and micrometeorites may have pulverized it into teeny pieces.

            The research is limited since it used mock moon dust, both crushed and uncrushed—it’s hard to get your hands on the real thing. And the cells were grown in a culture, rather than inside living creatures. But this work confirms older research that suggests moon dust could be hazardous to health.

            The simulated dust killed cells and altered DNA, especially right after it had been crushed up into smaller, micrometer-scale pieces. But there were surprises too: The dust’s chemical reactivity, measured in its ability to create reactive oxygen species (a kind of molecule you might call a free radical) had nothing to do with how likely it was to cause damage. Basically, it’s unclear why the dust was harmful—perhaps it had something to do with the shape of the pieces, suggested Demple.

            Now that the researchers have demonstrated danger with the simulated dust, they hope they’ve made enough of a case to acquire some real lunar dust from NASA that was recovered from the Apollo missions, Demple said.

            After all, if we’re going back to the moon, we should at least know what long-term exposure will do to astronauts’ health.

        preview: "Pascal Boyart is using QR codes to fuel his street art with Bitcoin donations",
        text: """
            We have come a long way since the times artists depended on the patronage of kings and queens for their financial stability. But while galleries and art dealers have mostly replaced this ancient system, a new breed of crowdfunded services like Patreon and Ulule are now lending even more fiscal independence to cash-strapped artists.

            Despite this liberating disruption in the artist-patron dynamic, such services pose the same risk to the financial security of creatives as the old patronage system, the revised art dealership model capitalism brought, and the crowdsourced funding alternative facilitated by the recent technological boom. Namely, that the artists are in a chronic threat of having their streams of income severed – at the drop of a hat.

            But thanks to blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies, creatives might have a new viable option to make ends meet without leaving their fiscal stability in the hands of profit-oriented dealers and corporations. Meet French street artist Pascal ‘PBOY’ Boyart.

            Boyart recently attracted the attention of the cryptocurrency community after one of his pieces made its way to the top of the Bitcoin discussion board on Reddit.

            Indeed, numerous Redditors flocked to salute him for his witty use of QR codes as a way of funding his work with Bitcoin donations from inspired passers-by.

            Influenced by the the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin, Boyart has made cryptocurrencies and decentralization a central theme in his work. In his paintings, Bitcoin becomes not only an integral part of the piece itself, but also the very method by which Boyart can profit from his creation.

            The QR codes are both his statement against the dangers of central censorship and his weapon of liberation.

            In this sense, his artistic fascination with the technology is two-fold: it explores how cryptocurrencies are gradually challenging the status quo of central authorities and simultaneously puts this playful exploration to the test.

            This, precisely, is the conundrum Boyart addresses in his mural of esteemed Dutch painter Rembrandt (whose life was marked by severe financial hardships despite his undeniable talent).

            But while it was the Rembrandt piece that brought the recognition of Reddit to Boyart, it wasn’t the first time the artist had experimented with incorporating Bitcoin donation addresses in his work.

            “I first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017,” Boyart told Hard Fork. “I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father ‘Dad, what is money?’ and I placed a QR code at the side of my signature.”

            I wasn’t sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations,” the artists added. “I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos’ book The Internet of Money.”

            Since then, Boyart has received over $1,000 (approximately 0.11 BTC) in donations so far, according to stats from the Bitcoin blockchain explorer.
        
            Boyart first got acquainted with Bitcoin in early 2014, but it took him four years to grasp the promise the technology behind it.

            “I didn’t understand it,” the artist told Hard Fork. “I thought it was a new PayPal.”

            “It was last May when I became really passionate about this new paradigm of money… I was thinking about all the best use cases artists can do with it,” Boyart continued. “It can free us from institutions and galleries.”

            “The most interesting aspect is decentralization – a peer-to-peer horizontal system,” he added. “Art and creation need that, I believe.”

            “My street art costs me a lot of money in materials and painting,” Boyart said. “But instead of funding alternatives like [crowdfunding platform] Ulule, I wanted a solution that offers direct financial relation with the people.”
“Bitcoin is perfect for this,” he added.

         category: .world,
         preview: "Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general who rose to prominence as an antagonist of the Trump administration, abruptly resigned on Monday night hours after The New Yorker reported that four women had accused him of physically assaulting them.",
         text: """
            “It’s been my great honor and privilege to serve as attorney general for the people of the State of New York,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. “In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me.

            “While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time. I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.”

            His resignation represented a stunning fall for a politician who had also assumed a prominent role in the #MeToo movement.

            Two of the women who spoke to the magazine, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, said they had been choked and hit repeatedly by Mr. Schneiderman. Both said they had sought medical treatment. Another woman, a lawyer, said she was slapped violently across the face. A fourth woman said she had similar experiences.

            All the women in the article, who had been romantically involved with Mr. Schneiderman, said the violence was not consensual.

            But not long after the allegations were made public, many of his allies, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who like Mr. Schneiderman is a Democrat, called for him to step down.

            “My personal opinion is that, given the damning pattern of facts and corroboration laid out in the article, I do not believe it is possible for Eric Schneiderman to continue to serve as attorney general,” Mr. Cuomo said.

            The call was echoed by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who led the charge to oust Al Franken from the Senate. “The violent actions described by multiple women in this story are abhorrent,” she said in a statement. “Based on this extensive and serious reporting, I do not believe that Eric Schneiderman should continue to serve as attorney general.”

            Under New York’s Constitution, Mr. Schneiderman’s replacement will be selected by the State Assembly and Senate by joint ballot — effectively placing the decision in the hands of the Assembly, which has many more members.

            The Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, planned to discuss possible replacements on Tuesday, according to Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Mr. Heastie. Whoever is chosen to fill out Mr. Schneiderman’s term could then seek election in November.

            No Democrat had declared an intention to challenge Mr. Schneiderman, who was up for re-election this year, in the primary; Manny Alicandro, a corporate lawyer from New York City, is running as a Republican and officially declared his candidacy on Monday.

            Since 2017, Mr. Schneiderman had raised his profile nationally by taking on President Trump’s agenda repeatedly in the courts. He was pushing to change state law so that his office could prosecute Mr. Trump’s aides even if the president pardoned them; his resignation makes the status of that effort less certain.

            Women’s issues had also been a focal point for Mr. Schneiderman, who had announced, for instance, a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. “We have never seen anything as despicable as what we’ve seen right here,” Mr. Schneiderman said then.

            Ms. Manning Barish, in The New Yorker account, described being slapped by Mr. Schneiderman after they had both been drinking; she and Ms. Selvaratnam said several of the attacks occurred after alcohol had been consumed.
    
            “It was horrendous,” she said. “It just came out of nowhere. My ear was ringing. I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed. I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him. I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down. He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me. The choking was very hard. It was really bad. I kicked. In every fiber, I felt I was being beaten by a man.”

            Debra S. Katz, a lawyer for Ms. Manning Barish, said that it was Mr. Schneiderman’s “fantasy and his fantasy alone that the behavior was welcome.”

            Mr. Schneiderman, she continued, “has made a career railing against this type of abuse. Yet apparently he intends to revictimize these courageous women who have come forward by pulling out that age old sexist trope that they wanted it.”

            Ms. Selvaratnam told the magazine that Mr. Schneiderman routinely drank to excess during their relationship, and that the physical abuse in bed got worse the longer she was with him. “We could rarely have sex without him beating me,” she said.

            The abuse was also verbal and emotional, she said. “He started calling me his ‘brown slave’ and demanding that I repeat that I was ‘his property.’”

            Both Ms. Manning Barish and Ms. Selvaratnam have in recent days repeatedly declined to comment when reporters for The New York Times asked them to address the allegations.

            “After I found out that other women had been abused by Attorney General Schneiderman in a similar manner many years before me, I wondered, who’s next, and knew something needed to be done,” Ms. Selvaratnam said in a statement released Monday night. “So I chose to come forward both to protect women who might enter into a relationship with him in the future but also to raise awareness around the issue of intimate partner violence.”

            Ms. Manning Barish followed the article’s publication with a post on Twitter, saying that she “could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me.”

            Mr. Schneiderman’s former wife said she was taken aback by the allegations being leveled against him.

            “I’ve known Eric for nearly 35 years as a husband, father and friend,” said Jennifer Cunningham, his ex-wife and frequent political strategist. “These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values and a loving father.”
    
            Mr. Schneiderman has long been regarded as one of the state’s most progressive politicians, even before his 2013 lawsuit against Trump University and his subsequent suits against the Trump administration made him the darling of the political left. Last fall, Mr. Schneiderman’s office proudly pointed to a segment on the late-night comedy show “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee,” in which the attorney general was described as “a hero who stood up to democracy’s nemesis,” a Superman-like character known as Schneider-man.

            His credentials as an advocate for women, in particular, had gone unquestioned.

            In 2010, as a state senator from Manhattan, he introduced a bill to make intentional strangulation to the point of unconsciousness a violent felony. That same year, the National Organization for Women’s New York branch endorsed him in his successful bid for attorney general, citing his “unmatched work” in “protecting women who are victims of domestic abuse.”

            For several years, his office has published a “Know Your Rights” brochure for victims of domestic violence. “We must recognize that our work keeping New Yorkers safe from domestic violence is far from over,” Mr. Schneiderman said in the announcement for the 2016 brochure.

            At the direction of Governor Cuomo, he was reviewing the 2015 decision by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein after an Italian model accused him of groping her.
            Mr. Vance’s office released a statement late Monday, saying that it had “opened an investigation into the recently reported allegations concerning Mr. Schneiderman.”

            Some national Republicans were gleeful at the allegations. The Republican research shop America Rising quickly packaged Mr. Schneiderman’s ties to other prominent national Democrats.

            Also on Monday evening, Mr. Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. dug up an old tweet from Mr. Schneiderman in which he said, “No one is above the law” and tweeted at him, “You were saying???”

On Monday afternoon, a criminal defense lawyer from Lankler Siffert & Wohl advised Mr. Scheiderman as he sought to respond to The New Yorker, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Later in the day, one of Mr. Schneiderman’s associates contacted several other law firms in an effort to retain a lawyer to represent him in connection with the criminal investigation, according to several people briefed on the matter.

            Ahmed Alsanawi might have as much insight into what makes a modern footballer a star as anyone, so when the Premier League's must-see barber starts talking about successors to David Beckham in the world of Premier League football, it's wise to take note.

            "David Beckham probably started this whole thing," Alsanawi tells Bleacher Report, "but I'd say Paul Pogba has replaced him. Anything Pogba does is breaking news."

            Pogba is the new Beckham. As a style icon, at least.

            And in today's game, players know that can be every bit as important to their public image as the number of assists and goals they score. Players are as relevant as the fashion choices they make. Or as the fashion choices people like Alsanawi make for them.

            Beckham's haircuts and tattoos helped set him aside as an icon of his time, but with the rise of social media, the many, not the few, appear similarly obsessed with their image.

            "There's something about Pogba," says Finlay Renwick, deputy style editor for Esquire magazine in London. "He's outlandish but definitely very cool."

            His risky fashion sense has become as famous as his ability. The France international has had more than 20 eccentric hairstyles since moving to Old Trafford in an £89 million transfer in 2016. His appeal as a role model was underlined last year as his eponymous PP clothing range for Adidas nearly sold out in one day.

            Fashion game aside, Pogba isn't having the best season of his career. So when he joined up with France team-mates recently sporting an outlandish Super Saiyan Blue hairstyle, the general reaction was that perhaps he should worry less about how he looks and more about improving his performances.

            But as Alsanawi explained, it's not that simple. Fashion does matter.

            "Football is everything to Pogba. I know that," says Alsanawi, who styles Pogba as well as other top players across Europe. "Because he has a bad game, that means he can't look good? I don't think so.

            "I have spoken to a lot of players about this issue, and they all told me the same thing: Having a good haircut gives you confidence.

            "Let's look at it a different way: If you go to a nightclub and want to chat to a girl, you won't do it if you're not feeling confident. It's the same in any part of life. So, when you step on a football pitch, if you look good, you will naturally feel better about everything you do on that pitch. It's as simple as that. Having a good haircut is like buying Gucci or Louis Vuitton. It's part of who you are."

            Alsanawi has become the game's trim king at a time when a player's hairstyle has become as important as his boots.

            Today's footballers want to stay relevant and cool in a game that is more high-profile than ever, largely thanks to the rise of platforms like Instagram. An on-point barber helps them achieve that.

            "Due to their platform and the hero worship that surrounds them, footballers have a propensity for 'peacock' style, so to speak," Renwick says. "It is something that seems to have increased with the rise of social media and the constant monitoring and scrutiny of the modern player."


            Alsanawi, of A Star Barbers in Chessington, a suburb half an hour from London, found his way into the game as Chelsea's first-team barber at their Cobham training ground, and his clientele today remains impressive. He usually visits players at home or in a team hotel. Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Borussia Dortmund's Michy Batshuayi and Manchester City star Benjamin Mendy are a few of the elite names who sit in his chair.

            "Social media has changed the game both for the barbers and celebrities," he says. "It's interesting that people can see my pictures with Pogba and see a normal bloke standing with a superstar."

            Pogba has been taking care of his hair for years, but other big names are new to the style scene. Part of Alsanawi's role is to act as an image consultant—even when a player does not seem interested.

            "I forced Eden Hazard to have a skin fade," he laughs. "He didn't want it, kept saying he was a family guy. But I had a vision for him, and it took about 18 months to persuade him to go with it.

            "Now he has a skin fade, line in his eyebrow, a shape up and a beard! He has an image and a look people actually now copy. I literally have people asking for Eden Hazard's haircut…but before this, he never really had a look he was known for."

            Danny Rossetter is a tattooist at Studio Voltage in Horley, Surrey, but will soon be joining Ahmed as a new branch of A Star.

            Most of his clients in the football world play at Chelsea and Brighton & Hove Albion, and he feels the tattoo industry is experiencing a boom.

            "Over the last five to eight years, it has picked up in football," he admits. "Obviously there was Beckham back in the 2000s, with his sleeves and back pieces by Louis Malloy up in Manchester. But recently it has really started to take off again.

            "At the moment, there are a few tattoos in football I really like. Leroy Sane has a great back piece of himself celebrating, Memphis Depay has a lion's head, and Andre Gray has a really cool piece made up of people like Muhammed Ali and Bob Marley.

            "British footballers seem to like a religious theme for some reason, whereas players from abroad tend to go for a more traditional look. I think a lot of it comes down to what the people around them have got and just following trends.

            "Players with families often get something reflecting their children, but the younger ones might not have that so just follow suit from others they have seen. Like most things, a lot of my work comes through word of mouth, but certainly more players seem to be getting tattoos now."

            It seems common that footballers have a pied-piper approach to many aspects of fashion. In their small training-ground communities, it is no surprise that it only takes one player to try a look that works and others suddenly follow.

            Clothing is also a big part of it.

            Sam Morgan is a personal shopper from north London who has become a major figure in the lives of players up and down the country. Top players earn seven-figure salaries and want to be seen in garments others simply can not get their hands on, so Morgan acts as their first port of call.

            "There are two main reasons footballers come to me for their clothes," Morgan explains. "Firstly I can source items that aren't available in the shops, and secondly I make the process hassle free for them.

            "Why would they want to go trawling around shops or the Internet when they can send me a message to sort it for them?"

            Morgan has helped make purchases for 250 players across every Premier League club over the past year and is in daily contact with stars over WhatsApp to help meet their needs.

            "Players tend to hear about me from someone else at the training ground and then get in touch," he explains. "Players tend not to just buy one thing at once, though. It's not unusual for them to spend £2,000 on four or five items.


            "Recently I sold a pair of shoes to one for £2,000, and someone else came to me with a £16,000 order for clothes. They pay by bank transfer. It's all very easy."

            Balenciaga, Fear of God, Amiri, Givenchy and Gucci are all in-demand brands at the moment, and Morgan uses contacts across the world to source and deliver items to a player's door.

            "Sometimes I deliver personally," he says. "Recently I was at the house of one player, and at 6 p.m. he asked if I could get a certain pair of shoes in a size nine. By 6.45 p.m., I had someone delivering them to the door! It's a fun job. I enjoy getting to know the players and it's great that so many trust me."

            It is one thing to look good in person, but being seen in the best cars, at the best holiday destinations, wearing the right watch and at the must-see events is vital, too.

            For all this and more, AC13 Premier and AC13 Lifestyle have become the go-to guys for footballers up and down the country.

            Marlon Harewood, the former West Ham United striker, heads the company, flanked by Riccardo Leighton and Andy Cole. Their main focus is helping to deliver bespoke cars for their clients—who range from England's Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy to Birmingham City's Che Adams and Arsenal women's captain Alex Scott.

            An in-vogue motor for elite stars right now is the Mercedes V-Class, with mod-cons such as Wi-Fi, TV, gaming system, reclining seats and starlight roof.

            "People always expect top players to move clubs and then buy a fancy house, but that is not so much the case anymore," explains Leighton, who has a background working in concierge.

            "Like anyone else, they don't want to be ripped off or wasting money, and a lot of players are actually buying luxury cars now instead of moving.

            "We have one client who has a driver and each day travels to training from London to Manchester. His seat fully reclines, and he sleeps through the journey. That isn't ideal for everyone, but it works for him. I know there are other players that do the same thing.

            "Some players don't just want them to sleep in, though. A lot like to have a starlight roof. Others like the back of the car to convert into an office so they can use laptops and make calls. Of course, there is often a Playstation or Xbox involved, too.

            "The benefit of using our company is that we can organise the whole purchase for them. We can buy the car and then add all the extras or they can buy the car and we will convert it. We are there to make life easier for them."

            So, what does an expert make of today's Premier League of fashion?

            "I think footballers are considered important in terms of influence and reach, but footballers are—at least in the fashion industry—often viewed through the prism of being magpies who buy the most expensive, most brazen item of clothing and disregard how it actually looks on them, which is fair enough really," Esquire's Renwick says.

            " I think a lot of them grow up in a bubble where their style is influenced by their peers, the other players, which means they're competing to be the boldest one in the room. The guy with the 'best' stuff. I think that can also explain the tattoos and mad haircuts: wanting to be noticed.

            "In terms of standout figures in the game, I think that, aside from the old David Beckham line, Hector Bellerin of Arsenal is at least trying some daring looks at the moment and obviously has a very keen interest and knowledge of fashion.

            "Other than that, I think Xabi Alonso and Andrea Pirlo—despite being retired—still have that suave, continental look that I think a lot of football fans aspire towards."

            "It's not outlandish, but I think most guys want to look good in a suit, which they definitely do."

Whether it's "peacock" or "continental" or just the right clothes, tat or car, the goal's the same: the right image. Today's footballer knows he can't score that with just his boot.

        text: """
            Cancer has become a tops along with cardiovascular disease as leading causes of death in industrialized countries. Many cases of cancer only get diagnosed after the tumour has developed extensively, decreasing chances of recovery. Cure rates for prostate cancer is 32%, and 11% for colon cancer. Ability to detect tumours early and reliably would save a significant amount of lives and decreases need for lengthy, stressful, expensive treatments.
            Researchers have presented a possible solution for early warning via a synthetic gene network which will recognize lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancer at early stages when the level of calcium within blood becomes elevated due to tumour development. As calcium levels exceed a threshold value over a period of time signal cascade is triggered, which initiates production of the body’s tanning pigment melanin within the synthetic genetically modified cells, which forms a brown mole visible to the naked eye, that appears before the cancer becomes detectable through current conventional diagnosis. Mole appearance does not mean the person is likely to die, rather it means a tumour is developing in very early stages to seek clarification and treatment.
            Calcium was used as indicator as it regulated strongly within the body. Bones serve as buffer which can balance concentration differences, when too much calcium is detected this may serve as a warning sign that one of the four cancers is present. Early detection greatly increases chances of survival and elimination. If breast cancer is detected early there is a 98% chance of recovery, if diagnosed too late sadly that number drops greatly to being only one in four having a good chance of recovery. Typically people don’t know and only go to see a doctor when the tumour begins to cause issues, which unfortunately is too late by that point most often.
            The synthetic early warning implant is primarily for self monitoring and is cost effective. An implant can also be used which develops a mark which is only visible under a red light which could be checked out by their doctor for those that may think the other method carries too much stress as an added advantage. Disadvantage would be that this implant service life is limited to about one year according to their studies, after which it must be inactivated and replaced. Biomedical tattoo is another concept is also a new finding that is also applicable to other gradually developing illness such as hormonal disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in which the team would replace the molecular sensor to measure biomarkers other than calcium.
The prototype early warning system has been functioning reliably during lab tests on model mouse and pig skin. It is noted that there still is a way to go before human testing can begin, sighting continued development and clinical trials are labor extensive and expensive, which the research group can not afford on their own, the team would like to promote translation of developments so one day they will lead to applicable products, estimating that it will take at least ten years of research and development to bring the cancer diagnostics implant to market maturity.

        text: """
            Gathered around a white plastic table, four scientists surgically explored a quaking pile of mud, freshly scraped from the bottom of the ocean and spiked with twitching tentacles and antennae. In the persistent dusk of an Arctic October, illuminated only by the navigation lights of their ship, the scientists’ orange rubber jumpsuits looked like a collection of traffic cones, bright and reflective against the murky sky. With long tweezers, the researchers organized the mess before them into tidy piles of sponges, starfish, and squirts, delicately picking each out of the morass as if extracting a prized shrimp from a takeout carton of lo mein. I hopped back and forth behind them, trying to stay warm in the biting ocean air and out of range of any sludge flung from the work area. Even in the Arctic, mud is still mud—copious, dirty, and potentially filled with life.

            Traveling the world to see microbes, plants, and animals in oceans, grasslands, forests, deserts, the icy poles—and wherever else they may be.

            To the 24 scientists on board the Helmer Hanssen, a 209-foot, navy-blue-hulled fishing-boat-turned-research-vessel, the scene was deeply familiar. Most of the members of the team are based in Norway, at the University of Tromsø—the northernmost university in the world—where they are part of a lab called Marbio; the Helmer Hanssen is their home during annual, and sometimes biannual, trips in search of undiscovered organisms. The group is looking for compounds that have novel effects on other living substances, hoping that some of their finds will lead to new, lifesaving treatments for cancer and drug-resistant infections in humans. Their type of mission—traveling deep into rain forests, or to the top of the world, to look for rare, microscopic life—is called bioprospecting. The Helmer Hanssen had just embarked on its 14th bioprospecting trip in half as many years (the 13th was skipped superstitiously), and this time, I had been invited along on the voyage.

            Two days earlier, our expedition had departed from Longyearbyen, a utilitarian settlement on the island of Spitsbergen in the archipelago of Svalbard. Halfway between the Norwegian mainland and the North Pole, Svalbard is an Arctic outpost frequented mostly by fossil-fuel experts, adventure tourists, and scientists.


            For the first few days, we sailed among Svalbard’s fjords and islands, moving gradually north. Eventually, we would lose sight of land, becoming entirely surrounded by ocean and, later, by ice. Every day, and every mile, would bring us closer to what everyone on board called mørketiden, “the dark time,” the season when the highest reaches of the Arctic Circle receive no sunlight. Our goal was 82 degrees latitude—the farthest north the team had ever traveled.

            We would be at sea 12 days, and the work would be continuous: The Marbio team was divided into two watches that worked alternating six-hour shifts, collecting samples by scraping the ocean floor, trawling its waters, and picking its shores. Some of the scientists on board focused on compounds with antimicrobial properties; others were in the business of measuring chlorophyll and capturing microalgae. Four of us had never been on the Helmer Hanssen, but the rest of the scientists were used to the boat and the sea, and attuned to the whims of both. No matter his or her specialty or level of experience, a tolerance of both the work and the waiting was required to scout promise in a brooding sea.

            One night, as I sat in the ship’s instrument room with the trip’s bearded leader, Hans Christian Eilertsen, he acknowledged the tough odds of bioprospecting. “It’s very much like looking for a needle in a haystack,” he said with a comfortable chuckle.


            For Eilertsen and his colleagues, the gamble is hard to resist. Imagine a starfish the size of your thumbnail, its stubby arms curling skyward like a baby’s. Folded inside the little animal, underneath its knobbly pink skin, are ribbons of DNA and enzymes, millions of years of information stored 15,000 feet below the surface of the Arctic Ocean. For humans, these microscopic structures might be lifesaving—or they might mean nothing at all. The only way to find out is to find the starfish.

            For thousands of years, nature has provided humans with medicine. The Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian text from 1550 b.c., recommended plants, minerals, and other natural products for the relief of everything from urinary-tract infections to wrinkles. At least some of these ancient prescriptions were effective: Honey, recommended for infected wounds, does have antibiotic properties, and coriander, recommended for pain, is a mild analgesic. You probably have at least one plant-based drug in your medicine cabinet. Aspirin was originally made from the bark and leaves of the white willow tree. Taxol, a common anticancer drug, comes from the Pacific yew tree. And nearly a century ago, penicillin was isolated from a species of mold that sprung up, uninvited, in a London professor’s petri dish.

            Sixty percent of the drugs we take today were developed from natural products, and most of those products have terrestrial sources. Currently, only seven FDA-approved pharmaceuticals in clinical use have marine sources, compared to hundreds of land-based drugs. And while scientists have isolated more than 30,000 unique organic compounds from marine organisms, they believe there are hundreds of thousands more to be found.


            But reaching the bottom of the ocean is a much more labor- and technology-intensive operation than, say, trekking into a rain forest in Costa Rica. Only with the advent of scuba technology in the 1950s were humans able to spend sustained time foraging underwater. And while researchers might need only 50 grams of sea sponge for initial product testing, any commercial product requires far more raw material—and consequently far more time, risk, and cost.

            Marbio is one of several international lab groups to take to the high seas, and often these groups pool both their financial resources and their search efforts. Most recently, Marbio took part in PharmaSea, an EU-funded, international consortium of 24 different partners, that collaborated in a search of both warm and cold oceans.

            Marbio, however, is a leader among teams working regularly in the Arctic. To survive in extreme conditions, many Arctic organisms have evolved unique and unusually potent chemical defenses, so in theory, products derived from cold-water organisms could be more effective than those from warmer regions. But because human bioprospectors in the Arctic must contend with extreme conditions, too, the search for microscopic life in our cold oceans is just getting started.

            ***

            Svalbard has a total landmass about the size of West Virginia, but in 2017, its human population was a mere 2,210. Beginning in the 1600s, the largest island, Spitsbergen, served as a walrus-hunting and whaling hub for the English, Dutch, and French, and later was sparsely populated by Russian coal miners. During the Helmer Hanssen’s journey through the archipelago, we encountered the flotsam and jetsam of human activity: abandoned outposts and weather stations, the occasional brick—bright as a flare against the beige scenery—and, of course, lots and lots of plastic. But save for the persistent seabirds, we were completely alone.

            On the voyage’s first full day, Eilertsen selected a Ph.D. student named Teppo Rämä and I for a shore-picking voyage. Rämä’s work focuses on the antibiotic potential of fungi, and we would be scavenging the icy beach at the base of the island’s fjords in search of it. Mummified in my heavy, waterproof, yellow-and-blue Arctic suit, I joined Eilertsen, Rämä and a member of the ship’s crew in an outboard-powered skiff. As we ripped toward shore, a walrus surfaced near our little inflatable dinghy, and I was startled by the size and proximity of its huge, tusked head, a boulder rising from the water.

            When we reached land, I stumbled while dismounting from the skiff, and my phone fell from my pocket into the cold brine of the ocean, never to be seen again. We had already traveled above the horizon of the satellites that serve mainland Europe, so on the boat cell service was intermittent, announced only by the sudden pings of a slew of missed texts. Now, without even that tenuous link to civilization, I’d have to fully embrace the solitude of the Arctic.

            Ashore, Eilertsen and Rämä took off in different directions while I stayed near the armed crewman, mindful of the very real possibility of a polar-bear encounter. Though it was just after lunch, dusk had already fallen. We worked under the pink sky, crouching among frosted rocks and the logs washed up from Siberia, frozen but still fecund. Using his serrated paring knife, Rämä harvested a small, square sample from one of the beached logs, secured it in a Ziploc baggie, and moved down the frost-speckled beach.


            To travel so far, and into such inhospitable territory, on such slim hopes may seem foolish, but the need for new drugs, and particularly new antibiotics, is pressing. One recent study predicted that by 2050, if nothing is done to combat the global overuse of antibiotics and the resulting rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, infections will kill more people per year than cancer. The implications—for human life expectancy and for society as a whole—are so grim that experts refer to this future reckoning as “antibiotic winter.”

            On the silent Svalbard coast, Rämä and Eilertsen traipsed on, filling their baggies with algae scraped from logs and rocks. The beach was scattered with shin-high icebergs laced with holes; jellyfish lay on the sand like so many magenta lily pads. Later, I would ask Eilertsen how he and Rämä knew where to look, and exactly what they were looking for. Eilertsen tried to explain their methods, but acknowledged that they were heavily influenced by circumstances and their inability to control them. “Teppo, he’s looking for fungi on old driftwood, and it’s peculiar,” he said making a that crazy kid face. “But I mean, he could find gold. Who knows?”

            Onboard the Helmer Hanssen, the researchers rotated between sampling the ocean and sampling the food. Breakfast was an array of porridges and eggs, meats and cheeses, laid out like an unusually wholesome Vegas buffet. Lunch tended to be warm, hearty, and stew-like, a midday reward for engaging with the elements. By dinnertime, a feast even by land standards, I could usually manage only a small serving of lutefisk and whale meatballs before rolling off to sleep.

            After following the west coast of Svalbard for several days, we turned northwest toward Greenland and the open sea, heading for the Yermak Plateau. Though the Arctic Ocean is the world’s smallest, its depth can reach nearly 18,000 feet—more than three miles—in parts of the Arctic Circle, and a plateau on the ocean floor is a rare sampling opportunity. By the time we reached Yermak, the crew’s daily routine was well established: At 9 a.m., after breakfast, the entire group gathered in the instrument room, a communal space where a wall of monitors displayed various updates about the voyage, including a live video feed from the shelter deck where the hauls of ocean mud were raised. During the meeting, Eilertsen, outfitted in his cruise uniform—a black button-up shirt tucked into black chinos, with a baby-blue comb in his back pocket—went over the day’s schedule.

            The scuba divers, one each from Greenland, Norway, and Italy, had arguably the hardest jobs on the ship. Though the team used an underwater drone for initial surveys, retrieving specimens required humans, and most days the three men made multiple dives. Every few hours, the crew would also lower a dragging device—part bucket, part claw—from the back of the ship, dredge up a wheelbarrow’s worth of mud, and deliver it to the white plastic table and a group of waiting scientists.

            After the morning briefing, half of the crew members returned to their bunks for rest while the rest began a six-hour shift of sampling. At 2 p.m., the watches switched. The Helmer Hanssen had six decks, with bunks scattered among them. My bunk, located in the ship’s bow a floor above on the shelter deck, was a windowless nook with an enclosed bunk bed, a small locker and a plush chair with a foot-long table protruding from one wall. The mess, on the ship’s fourth floor or topgallant deck, was cozy and couch-lined, and every night after dinner, the scientists—one shift putting off going to bed, the other putting off starting to work—would allow themselves an interlude of tea drinking, knitting, and chitchat. During occasional spells of satellite service, we would watch Norwegian prime-time shows like Farmen, a reality show in which contestants are forced to live on a farm with no electricity or running water and compete in games like axe throwing.


            The bridge, a quiet, carpeted room ringed with windows, was a refuge from the engine noise and industrial chill that permeated the rest of the ship. It had books and binoculars, and its quiet was only occasionally broken by the crackle of the captain’s radio. The room was the perfect place for staring—by day into the infinite water, dotted with schools of dolphins and spouts of whales, and by night at the northern lights, whose vibrating glow consumed the sky. From the bridge, it was clear that our tiny vessel floated on an enormous ocean, and that the world wasn’t ours. Instead, we were just a few dozen creatures cast among countless others.

            ***

            Despite the depth and breadth of human ingenuity—our ability to accelerate particles, send men to the moon and rovers to Mars, produce lifesaving drugs, watch American Ninja Warrior via satellite TV on a boat within the Arctic Circle—it’s still difficult for us to outfox bacteria, which can duck, evade, and even fight back against our antibiotic attacks.

            One way to outwit bacteria is to sneak up on them incognito, disguising an existing antibiotic by slightly changing its structure. This technique is relatively inexpensive, but risks creating a drug that the target bacteria are already somewhat familiar with, increasing the likelihood of resistance. Another method involves finding completely novel molecules and turning them into drugs unfamiliar to at least some dangerous bacteria. But this practice, as the members of Marbio well know, can be dramatically more difficult. As Jeanette Andersen, the head of Marbio, told me, “you don’t know what you’re looking for.”

            The search for the unknown takes lots of time and lots of money: The cost of an average day aboard the Helmer Hanssen is about 200,000 Norwegian kroner, or $25,500. Funding comes into the Marbio lab in a variety of ways, including from the university, the Norwegian government, commercial partners and external grants. And trips must be made with regularity, as even frozen samples can degrade in the laboratory.

            After the Helmer Hanssen had returned to port, I visited the Marbio lab in Tromsø, where the team members were beginning to process the hundreds of samples from the trip. They screened each sample to determine its structural information, elemental composition and biological activity, then checked their data against international databases. Had they found a known compound? If so, they returned to their collection of new samples. Had they found a known compound with novel activity? If so, they studied it more closely. Had they found a novel compound with novel bioactivity? If so, their work had only begun. Though years of trial and error stood between the researchers and a new drug, there seemed to be no misgivings about the worthiness of the work.

            Since 2007, the Marbio team, participating in a project called MabCent, has spent more than a full year at sea and sampled from over 1,000 different locations around the Svalbard archipelago. They have collected 1,200 different species of invertebrates and hundreds of species of microalgae, totaling more than 3,000 pounds of organisms. And while the work has not yet led to any commercially available drugs, the team has made promising finds, such as a molecule, isolated from a sponge, that has strong antioxidant activity relevant to cancer and diabetes. So strong, in fact, that its effects are now being tested in mouse studies. And gradually, Marbio’s work is helping to narrow its search: Their sample analysis suggests, for example, that Arctic invertebrates have more potential for anticancer compounds, and that fungi are more likely to yield antibiotics.


            Bringing a new drug to market—discovering a new compound on land or sea and developing it into a pill ready to swallow—costs, on average, more than $2.5 billion, and takes about 10 years. Even given enough money and time, the odds of success are long: Of the drugs being developed worldwide that make it to clinical testing, only about 12 percent are approved for commercial sale. Antibiotics, which don’t command high prices and can be rendered useless by fast-evolving bacteria, are risky investments for drug manufacturers, who prefer to invest in the research and development of lifestyle drugs. A diabetes medication, meant to be taken every day for the rest of one’s life, is more profitable than an antibiotic created to be taken only in dire situations.

            As I walked down one of the lab’s sterile hallways with Andersen, she acknowledged that new drugs are by no means a complete solution to the antibiotic crisis. “I think it would be very naïve to think that we will solve everything by finding a new antibiotic, because we know that it will eventually develop resistance for that molecule,” Andersen said soberly. “But I think we should find new things, because there should be things in development that could be used as a last resort.”

            The voyage itself was full of improvisation: The Helmer Hanssen was forced to change course when conditions were unnavigable, and to move on when samples yielded nothing new or useful. The main purpose of our trip was to take advantage of a waning summer thaw to get farther north than typically possible, but when we reached 81.5 degrees latitude, less than 1 degree short of our objective, the team discovered that high winds had packed swirling pancakes of ice into a giant, nearly unbroken sheet. We stood on the deck in the purple Arctic glow, gazing out at an eerily wind-pocked ice field that disappeared into the sky at the horizon in a jewel-toned wash of light.

            In order to sample the ocean, the scientists would have to stand on the ice, which wobbled dangerously in the waves. I watched from the deck as the researchers descended to the ice via a rickety gangplank, using shovels to keep their balance and ladders to traverse the shifting floes.

            When they reached a fissure, some researchers lay on their bellies, scraping at the ice with small knives, while others jabbed at it with shovels, ad-libbing in the chaotic conditions. After about 45 minutes, the group returned with buckets and baggies of shaved ice, ready to be tossed into the ship’s walk-in lab freezer for preservation. But our stay so far north would be short-lived. The crew had decided that the ice would soon envelop the boat, making it impossible to retreat to open water. That night, the Helmer Hanssen turned southward, and Eilertsen began to plot a new course.

            Even though the team had not reached 82 degrees, no one seemed disappointed. The hit-or-miss nature of bioprospecting, and the rarity of a bonanza, generally tempered expectations.

            One night, over after-dinner cups of tea during our three-day straight shot across the open Arctic Ocean back to the Norwegian mainland, I asked Klara Stensvåg, a microbiologist, whether the trip had been a success.

            Shocked by the suggestion that it had not, Stensvåg folded over her phone’s pink leather cover and began scrolling through her pictures, pausing at an image of an orange ball covered in pimples. “This,” she said, gesturing at the blob. “We had wanted it for a couple of years and at Bjørnøya, we got it.” It was a sea squirt called Synoicum pulmonaria, known for its bioactivity against bacteria, and it had been on Stensvåg’s wish list for a long time. The team had only collected one on this voyage, but as Stevnsvåg said, “Even one is good.”


            Bjørnøya—“Bear Island”—halfway between Svalbard and mainland Norway, had not been on the original itinerary; only because of the unforeseen ice conditions had the team decided to make a stop. Stensvåg gazed at the image on her phone, zooming in on it, marveling at her luck. “It felt like an orange,” she said, recalling the moment when the divers, back from another chilly mission, presented her with the little ball.

            Any discovery in the ocean, I was learning, required both relentlessness and luck. At one point during one of our evening conversations in the instrument room, Eilertsen confessed, “To be honest, a full cruise can be a waste—but we don’t know that beforehand, so we must continue.” Though always useful in terms of gathering samples, not every trip yielded something novel. “It’s like a lottery ticket you must buy again and again.”

            ***

            Earlier in the trip, about a week after leaving Longyearbyen, we visited an island named Moffen, off the northwest tip of Svalbard. Flat and shaped like a corona, with a lagoon at its center, Moffen felt like a floating beach, barely breaking the surface of the ocean. In the 1700s, this particular island was a center of walrus slaughtering; by the middle of the 20th century, the walrus population around Svalbard was nearly extinct. In 1983, the Norwegian government protected the island as a sanctuary so that the walrus population could reestablish itself.


            Eilertsen insisted we all get off the boat and go ashore. He argued that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and besides, we needed the exercise. Once all 24 of us had shuttled to Moffen in the skiff, we scattered, as we were apt to do whenever released from the confines of the Helmer Hanssen. Pairs of scientists turned over rocks, or squatted and examined whale vertebrae the size of Frisbees. A small group of Ph.D. students inspected the frozen body of a dead duck. In the distance, I spotted two seesawing on one of the washed-up Siberian logs. Eilertsen urged us to hurry, which was difficult given that we were wearing our cumbersome survival suits, and full of another enormous Norwegian lunch. The wind gusted by like a passing train, eliminating conversation. We reached a field of walrus bones, the slaughtering ground from generations before. The bones were covered in soft algae, the first green I had seen in days.

“There’s something special about the ice,” one of the Ph.D. students had said to me early in the voyage. “The first time I came up here, I couldn’t sleep. I just stared at the ice.” Everyone who has traveled above 80 degrees latitude seems similarly enchanted. For many, the vast emptiness of the Arctic feels full of potential—of organisms still unknown, of limits not yet reached. That afternoon on Moffen, a place home to wild animals, I understood the spell. Our trip was only halfway over, but already I was missing the Arctic Ocean. The sea belongs to the creatures that swim beneath its surface, not the ones who temporarily float on top of it. But I knew there would be days in the future when I would wish for an excuse to return, to recapture that feeling of frozen expanse, of treasures yet to be found.
