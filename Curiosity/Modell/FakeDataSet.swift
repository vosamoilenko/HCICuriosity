            Police removed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny from a rally in Moscow's Pushkin Square, carrying him off by his arms and legs.

            Officers used batons against protesters, with many in the crowd chanting "Putin is a thief!" and "Russia will be free!"

            Part of St Petersburg's famous avenue Nevsky Prospekt was blocked off by police as a crowd of roughly 1,000 demonstrators marched through the city.

            The country's interior ministry said about half of the 1,200 arrests happened in Moscow, but monitoring group OVD-Info put the number at more than 1,600 across 20 cities.

            Mr Putin's critics say he is more of a tsar than a democratic leader.

            Mr Navalny, who has been repeatedly detained and jailed for organising protests, published a message ahead of the marches saying: "If you think that he is not our tsar, take to the streets of your cities.

            "We will force the authorities, made up of swindlers and thieves, to reckon with the millions of citizens who did not vote for Putin."

            Mr Navalny called for rallies in more than 90 towns and cities, including   Moscow and St Petersburg.

            A Twitter account supporting Mr Navalny posted images from the protests, showing a stream of people waving Russian flags and carrying red balloons.

            The authorities regard most of the protests as illegal, arguing that their time and place was not agreed with them beforehand.

            One activist told a crowd in the city of Khabarovsk: "Putin has already been on his throne for 18 years! We've ended up in a dead end over these 18 years. I don't want to put up with this!"

            Mr Putin, 65, was re-elected in a landslide victory in March - extending his grip over the world's largest country until 2024. He will be inaugurated on Monday.

            He has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000.

            His victory makes him the longest-lasting leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, who ruled for nearly 30 years.

        text: """
            Shares in Apple, already the world's most valuable company, rose by almost 4% on Friday to more than $183.7 each.
            Mr Buffett said his Berkshire Hathaway group bought about 75 million more shares of the iPhone maker in the first three months of the year.
            His investment moves are closely watched across the world.
            Mr Buffett's company has been buying up shares in Apple since 2016. Berkshire Hathaway claimed a nearly 3.3% stake, or more than 166 million shares, at the end of last year.
            At the time, the holding, one of Berkshire's biggest stock market gambits, was worth more than $28bn.
            Now, after the additional share purchases and an 8% rise in price since the start of the year, the firm's stake is worth more than $44bn.
            Apple's market value now stands at almost $932bn.
            "It is an unbelievable company," Mr Buffett said in an interview with CNBC. "If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States."
            Some analysts have worried the technology giant's best days are behind it, as competition in the smart phone market increases and sales growth slows.
            But the company has been building up other lines of business, including the services unit that includes the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay.
            Apple this week reported profit of $13.8bn in the first three months of the year, rising 25% from the same period in 2017.
            The company also has a generous share buyback and dividend programme that is expanding.
            Apple, citing new US tax cuts, this week said it would buy back $100bn worth of shares and increase its dividend.
            The moves, which return money to its shareholders, had been widely anticipated in the aftermath of the new tax law, which lowered the corporate tax rate and reduced the incentives for firms to hoard cash overseas.
            Berkshire Hathaway will host its annual meeting for shareholders in Omaha, Nebraska this weekend.

            "I accept the consequences of this vote and will tender my resignation to the boards of Air France and Air France-KLM in coming days," he said.
            In a ballot, 55% of the French employees rejected the deal.
            Air France-KLM - one of Europe's biggest airlines - has seen a series of strikes in recent weeks.
            The industrial action has cost the Franco-Dutch alliance millions of euros.
            In the ballot, company employees rejected a 7% pay rise over the next four years.
            They have been demanding a 5.1% increase in 2018 instead - in a dispute that began in February.

            "This is an enormous mess that will only put a smile on the faces of our competitors," Mr Janaillac told a news conference.
            He said he hoped his departure would spark "a more acute collective awareness" before leaving without taking questions.
            The 65-year-old chief executive, who had been in the job for less than two years, earlier promised to quit if the pay deal was rejected.
            He had been trying to cut costs at the company, amid rising competition from low-cost airlines and Gulf national carriers.
            He will officially resign next Wednesday, Air France-KLM said.
            'Pain'
            Meanwhile, the company's unions said further strikes would be staged in the coming days.
            Air France-KLM has already downgraded its profit and growth expectations for 2018.
            Air France and KLM merged in 2004. They transport tens of millions of passengers around the world every year.
            Labour reforms launched by French President Emmanuel Macron have also led to strikes by employees of the state-owned SNCF rail company.
            British Airways and Lufthansa have already undergone deep cost-cutting in recent years, and some analysts say Air France has lagged behind.
            "There is inevitably some pain for staff when structural changes are made, but once that is dealt with, you're left with a much healthier company," said aviation consultant John Strickland.
            "That has been proved in the cases of the turnarounds achieved by Iberia and British Airways."

        category: .science,
        preview: "Astronauts hoping stay on the moon for long-term missions have another reason to worry about moon dust: It could be quite harmful if inhaled, as demonstrated in a new study.",
        text: """
            We’ve long known that moon dust could cause trouble. During the Apollo missions, astronauts complained of sneezing and watery eyes after tracking dust from their spacesuits back into their ships. Scientists need to take moon dust and rocks into account when designing lunar landing equipment because it sticks to everything.

            No mice or humans were sent to the moon for this new study. Instead, scientists grew both human cells and mouse cells in the lab and exposed both to a simulated lunar dust. In both cases, the moon dust could kill the cell or damage the cells’ DNA.

            “Very small particles in the breathable range or smaller can interact directly with cells,” study author Bruce Demple, a professor at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine, told Gizmodo.

            Moon dust isn’t like Earth dust. Without weather or an atmosphere, the lunar soil is dry and potentially electrostatically charged, according to the paper published last month in GeoHealth. And billions of years of bombardment from meteorites and micrometeorites may have pulverized it into teeny pieces.

            The research is limited since it used mock moon dust, both crushed and uncrushed—it’s hard to get your hands on the real thing. And the cells were grown in a culture, rather than inside living creatures. But this work confirms older research that suggests moon dust could be hazardous to health.

            The simulated dust killed cells and altered DNA, especially right after it had been crushed up into smaller, micrometer-scale pieces. But there were surprises too: The dust’s chemical reactivity, measured in its ability to create reactive oxygen species (a kind of molecule you might call a free radical) had nothing to do with how likely it was to cause damage. Basically, it’s unclear why the dust was harmful—perhaps it had something to do with the shape of the pieces, suggested Demple.

            Now that the researchers have demonstrated danger with the simulated dust, they hope they’ve made enough of a case to acquire some real lunar dust from NASA that was recovered from the Apollo missions, Demple said.

            After all, if we’re going back to the moon, we should at least know what long-term exposure will do to astronauts’ health.

        category: .entertainment,
        preview: "Pascal Boyart is using QR codes to fuel his street art with Bitcoin donations",
        text: """
            We have come a long way since the times artists depended on the patronage of kings and queens for their financial stability. But while galleries and art dealers have mostly replaced this ancient system, a new breed of crowdfunded services like Patreon and Ulule are now lending even more fiscal independence to cash-strapped artists.

            Despite this liberating disruption in the artist-patron dynamic, such services pose the same risk to the financial security of creatives as the old patronage system, the revised art dealership model capitalism brought, and the crowdsourced funding alternative facilitated by the recent technological boom. Namely, that the artists are in a chronic threat of having their streams of income severed – at the drop of a hat.

            But thanks to blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies, creatives might have a new viable option to make ends meet without leaving their fiscal stability in the hands of profit-oriented dealers and corporations. Meet French street artist Pascal ‘PBOY’ Boyart.

            Boyart recently attracted the attention of the cryptocurrency community after one of his pieces made its way to the top of the Bitcoin discussion board on Reddit.

            Indeed, numerous Redditors flocked to salute him for his witty use of QR codes as a way of funding his work with Bitcoin donations from inspired passers-by.

            Influenced by the the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin, Boyart has made cryptocurrencies and decentralization a central theme in his work. In his paintings, Bitcoin becomes not only an integral part of the piece itself, but also the very method by which Boyart can profit from his creation.

            The QR codes are both his statement against the dangers of central censorship and his weapon of liberation.

            In this sense, his artistic fascination with the technology is two-fold: it explores how cryptocurrencies are gradually challenging the status quo of central authorities and simultaneously puts this playful exploration to the test.

            This, precisely, is the conundrum Boyart addresses in his mural of esteemed Dutch painter Rembrandt (whose life was marked by severe financial hardships despite his undeniable talent).

            But while it was the Rembrandt piece that brought the recognition of Reddit to Boyart, it wasn’t the first time the artist had experimented with incorporating Bitcoin donation addresses in his work.

            “I first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017,” Boyart told Hard Fork. “I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father ‘Dad, what is money?’ and I placed a QR code at the side of my signature.”

            I wasn’t sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations,” the artists added. “I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos’ book The Internet of Money.”

            Since then, Boyart has received over $1,000 (approximately 0.11 BTC) in donations so far, according to stats from the Bitcoin blockchain explorer.
        
            Boyart first got acquainted with Bitcoin in early 2014, but it took him four years to grasp the promise the technology behind it.

            “I didn’t understand it,” the artist told Hard Fork. “I thought it was a new PayPal.”

            “It was last May when I became really passionate about this new paradigm of money… I was thinking about all the best use cases artists can do with it,” Boyart continued. “It can free us from institutions and galleries.”

            “The most interesting aspect is decentralization – a peer-to-peer horizontal system,” he added. “Art and creation need that, I believe.”

            “My street art costs me a lot of money in materials and painting,” Boyart said. “But instead of funding alternatives like [crowdfunding platform] Ulule, I wanted a solution that offers direct financial relation with the people.”
“Bitcoin is perfect for this,” he added.

        category: .world,
        preview: "Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general who rose to prominence as an antagonist of the Trump administration, abruptly resigned on Monday night hours after The New Yorker reported that four women had accused him of physically assaulting them.",
        text: """
            “It’s been my great honor and privilege to serve as attorney general for the people of the State of New York,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. “In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me.

            “While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time. I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.”

            His resignation represented a stunning fall for a politician who had also assumed a prominent role in the #MeToo movement.

            Two of the women who spoke to the magazine, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, said they had been choked and hit repeatedly by Mr. Schneiderman. Both said they had sought medical treatment. Another woman, a lawyer, said she was slapped violently across the face. A fourth woman said she had similar experiences.

            All the women in the article, who had been romantically involved with Mr. Schneiderman, said the violence was not consensual.

            But not long after the allegations were made public, many of his allies, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who like Mr. Schneiderman is a Democrat, called for him to step down.

            “My personal opinion is that, given the damning pattern of facts and corroboration laid out in the article, I do not believe it is possible for Eric Schneiderman to continue to serve as attorney general,” Mr. Cuomo said.

            The call was echoed by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who led the charge to oust Al Franken from the Senate. “The violent actions described by multiple women in this story are abhorrent,” she said in a statement. “Based on this extensive and serious reporting, I do not believe that Eric Schneiderman should continue to serve as attorney general.”

            Under New York’s Constitution, Mr. Schneiderman’s replacement will be selected by the State Assembly and Senate by joint ballot — effectively placing the decision in the hands of the Assembly, which has many more members.

            The Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, planned to discuss possible replacements on Tuesday, according to Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Mr. Heastie. Whoever is chosen to fill out Mr. Schneiderman’s term could then seek election in November.

            No Democrat had declared an intention to challenge Mr. Schneiderman, who was up for re-election this year, in the primary; Manny Alicandro, a corporate lawyer from New York City, is running as a Republican and officially declared his candidacy on Monday.

            Since 2017, Mr. Schneiderman had raised his profile nationally by taking on President Trump’s agenda repeatedly in the courts. He was pushing to change state law so that his office could prosecute Mr. Trump’s aides even if the president pardoned them; his resignation makes the status of that effort less certain.

            Women’s issues had also been a focal point for Mr. Schneiderman, who had announced, for instance, a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. “We have never seen anything as despicable as what we’ve seen right here,” Mr. Schneiderman said then.

            Ms. Manning Barish, in The New Yorker account, described being slapped by Mr. Schneiderman after they had both been drinking; she and Ms. Selvaratnam said several of the attacks occurred after alcohol had been consumed.
         
            “It was horrendous,” she said. “It just came out of nowhere. My ear was ringing. I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed. I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him. I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down. He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me. The choking was very hard. It was really bad. I kicked. In every fiber, I felt I was being beaten by a man.”

            Debra S. Katz, a lawyer for Ms. Manning Barish, said that it was Mr. Schneiderman’s “fantasy and his fantasy alone that the behavior was welcome.”

            Mr. Schneiderman, she continued, “has made a career railing against this type of abuse. Yet apparently he intends to revictimize these courageous women who have come forward by pulling out that age old sexist trope that they wanted it.”

            Ms. Selvaratnam told the magazine that Mr. Schneiderman routinely drank to excess during their relationship, and that the physical abuse in bed got worse the longer she was with him. “We could rarely have sex without him beating me,” she said.

            The abuse was also verbal and emotional, she said. “He started calling me his ‘brown slave’ and demanding that I repeat that I was ‘his property.’”

            Both Ms. Manning Barish and Ms. Selvaratnam have in recent days repeatedly declined to comment when reporters for The New York Times asked them to address the allegations.

            “After I found out that other women had been abused by Attorney General Schneiderman in a similar manner many years before me, I wondered, who’s next, and knew something needed to be done,” Ms. Selvaratnam said in a statement released Monday night. “So I chose to come forward both to protect women who might enter into a relationship with him in the future but also to raise awareness around the issue of intimate partner violence.”

            Ms. Manning Barish followed the article’s publication with a post on Twitter, saying that she “could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me.”

            Mr. Schneiderman’s former wife said she was taken aback by the allegations being leveled against him.

            “I’ve known Eric for nearly 35 years as a husband, father and friend,” said Jennifer Cunningham, his ex-wife and frequent political strategist. “These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values and a loving father.”
         
            Mr. Schneiderman has long been regarded as one of the state’s most progressive politicians, even before his 2013 lawsuit against Trump University and his subsequent suits against the Trump administration made him the darling of the political left. Last fall, Mr. Schneiderman’s office proudly pointed to a segment on the late-night comedy show “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee,” in which the attorney general was described as “a hero who stood up to democracy’s nemesis,” a Superman-like character known as Schneider-man.

            His credentials as an advocate for women, in particular, had gone unquestioned.

            In 2010, as a state senator from Manhattan, he introduced a bill to make intentional strangulation to the point of unconsciousness a violent felony. That same year, the National Organization for Women’s New York branch endorsed him in his successful bid for attorney general, citing his “unmatched work” in “protecting women who are victims of domestic abuse.”

            For several years, his office has published a “Know Your Rights” brochure for victims of domestic violence. “We must recognize that our work keeping New Yorkers safe from domestic violence is far from over,” Mr. Schneiderman said in the announcement for the 2016 brochure.

            At the direction of Governor Cuomo, he was reviewing the 2015 decision by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein after an Italian model accused him of groping her.
            Mr. Vance’s office released a statement late Monday, saying that it had “opened an investigation into the recently reported allegations concerning Mr. Schneiderman.”

            Some national Republicans were gleeful at the allegations. The Republican research shop America Rising quickly packaged Mr. Schneiderman’s ties to other prominent national Democrats.

            Also on Monday evening, Mr. Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. dug up an old tweet from Mr. Schneiderman in which he said, “No one is above the law” and tweeted at him, “You were saying???”

            On Monday afternoon, a criminal defense lawyer from Lankler Siffert & Wohl advised Mr. Scheiderman as he sought to respond to The New Yorker, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Later in the day, one of Mr. Schneiderman’s associates contacted several other law firms in an effort to retain a lawyer to represent him in connection with the criminal investigation, according to several people briefed on the matter.

            Ahmed Alsanawi might have as much insight into what makes a modern footballer a star as anyone, so when the Premier League's must-see barber starts talking about successors to David Beckham in the world of Premier League football, it's wise to take note.

            "David Beckham probably started this whole thing," Alsanawi tells Bleacher Report, "but I'd say Paul Pogba has replaced him. Anything Pogba does is breaking news."

            Pogba is the new Beckham. As a style icon, at least.

            And in today's game, players know that can be every bit as important to their public image as the number of assists and goals they score. Players are as relevant as the fashion choices they make. Or as the fashion choices people like Alsanawi make for them.

            Beckham's haircuts and tattoos helped set him aside as an icon of his time, but with the rise of social media, the many, not the few, appear similarly obsessed with their image.

            "There's something about Pogba," says Finlay Renwick, deputy style editor for Esquire magazine in London. "He's outlandish but definitely very cool."

            His risky fashion sense has become as famous as his ability. The France international has had more than 20 eccentric hairstyles since moving to Old Trafford in an £89 million transfer in 2016. His appeal as a role model was underlined last year as his eponymous PP clothing range for Adidas nearly sold out in one day.

            Fashion game aside, Pogba isn't having the best season of his career. So when he joined up with France team-mates recently sporting an outlandish Super Saiyan Blue hairstyle, the general reaction was that perhaps he should worry less about how he looks and more about improving his performances.

            But as Alsanawi explained, it's not that simple. Fashion does matter.

            "Football is everything to Pogba. I know that," says Alsanawi, who styles Pogba as well as other top players across Europe. "Because he has a bad game, that means he can't look good? I don't think so.

            "I have spoken to a lot of players about this issue, and they all told me the same thing: Having a good haircut gives you confidence.

            "Let's look at it a different way: If you go to a nightclub and want to chat to a girl, you won't do it if you're not feeling confident. It's the same in any part of life. So, when you step on a football pitch, if you look good, you will naturally feel better about everything you do on that pitch. It's as simple as that. Having a good haircut is like buying Gucci or Louis Vuitton. It's part of who you are."

            Alsanawi has become the game's trim king at a time when a player's hairstyle has become as important as his boots.

            Today's footballers want to stay relevant and cool in a game that is more high-profile than ever, largely thanks to the rise of platforms like Instagram. An on-point barber helps them achieve that.

            "Due to their platform and the hero worship that surrounds them, footballers have a propensity for 'peacock' style, so to speak," Renwick says. "It is something that seems to have increased with the rise of social media and the constant monitoring and scrutiny of the modern player."


            Alsanawi, of A Star Barbers in Chessington, a suburb half an hour from London, found his way into the game as Chelsea's first-team barber at their Cobham training ground, and his clientele today remains impressive. He usually visits players at home or in a team hotel. Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Borussia Dortmund's Michy Batshuayi and Manchester City star Benjamin Mendy are a few of the elite names who sit in his chair.

            "Social media has changed the game both for the barbers and celebrities," he says. "It's interesting that people can see my pictures with Pogba and see a normal bloke standing with a superstar."

            Pogba has been taking care of his hair for years, but other big names are new to the style scene. Part of Alsanawi's role is to act as an image consultant—even when a player does not seem interested.

            "I forced Eden Hazard to have a skin fade," he laughs. "He didn't want it, kept saying he was a family guy. But I had a vision for him, and it took about 18 months to persuade him to go with it.

            "Now he has a skin fade, line in his eyebrow, a shape up and a beard! He has an image and a look people actually now copy. I literally have people asking for Eden Hazard's haircut…but before this, he never really had a look he was known for."

            Danny Rossetter is a tattooist at Studio Voltage in Horley, Surrey, but will soon be joining Ahmed as a new branch of A Star.

            Most of his clients in the football world play at Chelsea and Brighton & Hove Albion, and he feels the tattoo industry is experiencing a boom.

            "Over the last five to eight years, it has picked up in football," he admits. "Obviously there was Beckham back in the 2000s, with his sleeves and back pieces by Louis Malloy up in Manchester. But recently it has really started to take off again.

            "At the moment, there are a few tattoos in football I really like. Leroy Sane has a great back piece of himself celebrating, Memphis Depay has a lion's head, and Andre Gray has a really cool piece made up of people like Muhammed Ali and Bob Marley.

            "British footballers seem to like a religious theme for some reason, whereas players from abroad tend to go for a more traditional look. I think a lot of it comes down to what the people around them have got and just following trends.

            "Players with families often get something reflecting their children, but the younger ones might not have that so just follow suit from others they have seen. Like most things, a lot of my work comes through word of mouth, but certainly more players seem to be getting tattoos now."

            It seems common that footballers have a pied-piper approach to many aspects of fashion. In their small training-ground communities, it is no surprise that it only takes one player to try a look that works and others suddenly follow.

            Clothing is also a big part of it.

            Sam Morgan is a personal shopper from north London who has become a major figure in the lives of players up and down the country. Top players earn seven-figure salaries and want to be seen in garments others simply can not get their hands on, so Morgan acts as their first port of call.

            "There are two main reasons footballers come to me for their clothes," Morgan explains. "Firstly I can source items that aren't available in the shops, and secondly I make the process hassle free for them.

            "Why would they want to go trawling around shops or the Internet when they can send me a message to sort it for them?"

            Morgan has helped make purchases for 250 players across every Premier League club over the past year and is in daily contact with stars over WhatsApp to help meet their needs.

            "Players tend to hear about me from someone else at the training ground and then get in touch," he explains. "Players tend not to just buy one thing at once, though. It's not unusual for them to spend £2,000 on four or five items.


            "Recently I sold a pair of shoes to one for £2,000, and someone else came to me with a £16,000 order for clothes. They pay by bank transfer. It's all very easy."

            Balenciaga, Fear of God, Amiri, Givenchy and Gucci are all in-demand brands at the moment, and Morgan uses contacts across the world to source and deliver items to a player's door.

            "Sometimes I deliver personally," he says. "Recently I was at the house of one player, and at 6 p.m. he asked if I could get a certain pair of shoes in a size nine. By 6.45 p.m., I had someone delivering them to the door! It's a fun job. I enjoy getting to know the players and it's great that so many trust me."

            It is one thing to look good in person, but being seen in the best cars, at the best holiday destinations, wearing the right watch and at the must-see events is vital, too.

            For all this and more, AC13 Premier and AC13 Lifestyle have become the go-to guys for footballers up and down the country.

            Marlon Harewood, the former West Ham United striker, heads the company, flanked by Riccardo Leighton and Andy Cole. Their main focus is helping to deliver bespoke cars for their clients—who range from England's Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy to Birmingham City's Che Adams and Arsenal women's captain Alex Scott.

            An in-vogue motor for elite stars right now is the Mercedes V-Class, with mod-cons such as Wi-Fi, TV, gaming system, reclining seats and starlight roof.

            "People always expect top players to move clubs and then buy a fancy house, but that is not so much the case anymore," explains Leighton, who has a background working in concierge.

            "Like anyone else, they don't want to be ripped off or wasting money, and a lot of players are actually buying luxury cars now instead of moving.

            "We have one client who has a driver and each day travels to training from London to Manchester. His seat fully reclines, and he sleeps through the journey. That isn't ideal for everyone, but it works for him. I know there are other players that do the same thing.

            "Some players don't just want them to sleep in, though. A lot like to have a starlight roof. Others like the back of the car to convert into an office so they can use laptops and make calls. Of course, there is often a Playstation or Xbox involved, too.

            "The benefit of using our company is that we can organise the whole purchase for them. We can buy the car and then add all the extras or they can buy the car and we will convert it. We are there to make life easier for them."

            So, what does an expert make of today's Premier League of fashion?

            "I think footballers are considered important in terms of influence and reach, but footballers are—at least in the fashion industry—often viewed through the prism of being magpies who buy the most expensive, most brazen item of clothing and disregard how it actually looks on them, which is fair enough really," Esquire's Renwick says.

            " I think a lot of them grow up in a bubble where their style is influenced by their peers, the other players, which means they're competing to be the boldest one in the room. The guy with the 'best' stuff. I think that can also explain the tattoos and mad haircuts: wanting to be noticed.

            "In terms of standout figures in the game, I think that, aside from the old David Beckham line, Hector Bellerin of Arsenal is at least trying some daring looks at the moment and obviously has a very keen interest and knowledge of fashion.

            "Other than that, I think Xabi Alonso and Andrea Pirlo—despite being retired—still have that suave, continental look that I think a lot of football fans aspire towards."

            "It's not outlandish, but I think most guys want to look good in a suit, which they definitely do."

Whether it's "peacock" or "continental" or just the right clothes, tat or car, the goal's the same: the right image. Today's footballer knows he can't score that with just his boot.

        text: """
            Cancer has become a tops along with cardiovascular disease as leading causes of death in industrialized countries. Many cases of cancer only get diagnosed after the tumour has developed extensively, decreasing chances of recovery. Cure rates for prostate cancer is 32%, and 11% for colon cancer. Ability to detect tumours early and reliably would save a significant amount of lives and decreases need for lengthy, stressful, expensive treatments.
            Researchers have presented a possible solution for early warning via a synthetic gene network which will recognize lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancer at early stages when the level of calcium within blood becomes elevated due to tumour development. As calcium levels exceed a threshold value over a period of time signal cascade is triggered, which initiates production of the body’s tanning pigment melanin within the synthetic genetically modified cells, which forms a brown mole visible to the naked eye, that appears before the cancer becomes detectable through current conventional diagnosis. Mole appearance does not mean the person is likely to die, rather it means a tumour is developing in very early stages to seek clarification and treatment.
            Calcium was used as indicator as it regulated strongly within the body. Bones serve as buffer which can balance concentration differences, when too much calcium is detected this may serve as a warning sign that one of the four cancers is present. Early detection greatly increases chances of survival and elimination. If breast cancer is detected early there is a 98% chance of recovery, if diagnosed too late sadly that number drops greatly to being only one in four having a good chance of recovery. Typically people don’t know and only go to see a doctor when the tumour begins to cause issues, which unfortunately is too late by that point most often.
            The synthetic early warning implant is primarily for self monitoring and is cost effective. An implant can also be used which develops a mark which is only visible under a red light which could be checked out by their doctor for those that may think the other method carries too much stress as an added advantage. Disadvantage would be that this implant service life is limited to about one year according to their studies, after which it must be inactivated and replaced. Biomedical tattoo is another concept is also a new finding that is also applicable to other gradually developing illness such as hormonal disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in which the team would replace the molecular sensor to measure biomarkers other than calcium.
The prototype early warning system has been functioning reliably during lab tests on model mouse and pig skin. It is noted that there still is a way to go before human testing can begin, sighting continued development and clinical trials are labor extensive and expensive, which the research group can not afford on their own, the team would like to promote translation of developments so one day they will lead to applicable products, estimating that it will take at least ten years of research and development to bring the cancer diagnostics implant to market maturity.

        text: """
            Gathered around a white plastic table, four scientists surgically explored a quaking pile of mud, freshly scraped from the bottom of the ocean and spiked with twitching tentacles and antennae. In the persistent dusk of an Arctic October, illuminated only by the navigation lights of their ship, the scientists’ orange rubber jumpsuits looked like a collection of traffic cones, bright and reflective against the murky sky. With long tweezers, the researchers organized the mess before them into tidy piles of sponges, starfish, and squirts, delicately picking each out of the morass as if extracting a prized shrimp from a takeout carton of lo mein. I hopped back and forth behind them, trying to stay warm in the biting ocean air and out of range of any sludge flung from the work area. Even in the Arctic, mud is still mud—copious, dirty, and potentially filled with life.

            Traveling the world to see microbes, plants, and animals in oceans, grasslands, forests, deserts, the icy poles—and wherever else they may be.

            To the 24 scientists on board the Helmer Hanssen, a 209-foot, navy-blue-hulled fishing-boat-turned-research-vessel, the scene was deeply familiar. Most of the members of the team are based in Norway, at the University of Tromsø—the northernmost university in the world—where they are part of a lab called Marbio; the Helmer Hanssen is their home during annual, and sometimes biannual, trips in search of undiscovered organisms. The group is looking for compounds that have novel effects on other living substances, hoping that some of their finds will lead to new, lifesaving treatments for cancer and drug-resistant infections in humans. Their type of mission—traveling deep into rain forests, or to the top of the world, to look for rare, microscopic life—is called bioprospecting. The Helmer Hanssen had just embarked on its 14th bioprospecting trip in half as many years (the 13th was skipped superstitiously), and this time, I had been invited along on the voyage.

            Two days earlier, our expedition had departed from Longyearbyen, a utilitarian settlement on the island of Spitsbergen in the archipelago of Svalbard. Halfway between the Norwegian mainland and the North Pole, Svalbard is an Arctic outpost frequented mostly by fossil-fuel experts, adventure tourists, and scientists.


            For the first few days, we sailed among Svalbard’s fjords and islands, moving gradually north. Eventually, we would lose sight of land, becoming entirely surrounded by ocean and, later, by ice. Every day, and every mile, would bring us closer to what everyone on board called mørketiden, “the dark time,” the season when the highest reaches of the Arctic Circle receive no sunlight. Our goal was 82 degrees latitude—the farthest north the team had ever traveled.

            We would be at sea 12 days, and the work would be continuous: The Marbio team was divided into two watches that worked alternating six-hour shifts, collecting samples by scraping the ocean floor, trawling its waters, and picking its shores. Some of the scientists on board focused on compounds with antimicrobial properties; others were in the business of measuring chlorophyll and capturing microalgae. Four of us had never been on the Helmer Hanssen, but the rest of the scientists were used to the boat and the sea, and attuned to the whims of both. No matter his or her specialty or level of experience, a tolerance of both the work and the waiting was required to scout promise in a brooding sea.

            One night, as I sat in the ship’s instrument room with the trip’s bearded leader, Hans Christian Eilertsen, he acknowledged the tough odds of bioprospecting. “It’s very much like looking for a needle in a haystack,” he said with a comfortable chuckle.


            For Eilertsen and his colleagues, the gamble is hard to resist. Imagine a starfish the size of your thumbnail, its stubby arms curling skyward like a baby’s. Folded inside the little animal, underneath its knobbly pink skin, are ribbons of DNA and enzymes, millions of years of information stored 15,000 feet below the surface of the Arctic Ocean. For humans, these microscopic structures might be lifesaving—or they might mean nothing at all. The only way to find out is to find the starfish.

            For thousands of years, nature has provided humans with medicine. The Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian text from 1550 b.c., recommended plants, minerals, and other natural products for the relief of everything from urinary-tract infections to wrinkles. At least some of these ancient prescriptions were effective: Honey, recommended for infected wounds, does have antibiotic properties, and coriander, recommended for pain, is a mild analgesic. You probably have at least one plant-based drug in your medicine cabinet. Aspirin was originally made from the bark and leaves of the white willow tree. Taxol, a common anticancer drug, comes from the Pacific yew tree. And nearly a century ago, penicillin was isolated from a species of mold that sprung up, uninvited, in a London professor’s petri dish.

            Sixty percent of the drugs we take today were developed from natural products, and most of those products have terrestrial sources. Currently, only seven FDA-approved pharmaceuticals in clinical use have marine sources, compared to hundreds of land-based drugs. And while scientists have isolated more than 30,000 unique organic compounds from marine organisms, they believe there are hundreds of thousands more to be found.


            But reaching the bottom of the ocean is a much more labor- and technology-intensive operation than, say, trekking into a rain forest in Costa Rica. Only with the advent of scuba technology in the 1950s were humans able to spend sustained time foraging underwater. And while researchers might need only 50 grams of sea sponge for initial product testing, any commercial product requires far more raw material—and consequently far more time, risk, and cost.

            Marbio is one of several international lab groups to take to the high seas, and often these groups pool both their financial resources and their search efforts. Most recently, Marbio took part in PharmaSea, an EU-funded, international consortium of 24 different partners, that collaborated in a search of both warm and cold oceans.

            Marbio, however, is a leader among teams working regularly in the Arctic. To survive in extreme conditions, many Arctic organisms have evolved unique and unusually potent chemical defenses, so in theory, products derived from cold-water organisms could be more effective than those from warmer regions. But because human bioprospectors in the Arctic must contend with extreme conditions, too, the search for microscopic life in our cold oceans is just getting started.

            ***

            Svalbard has a total landmass about the size of West Virginia, but in 2017, its human population was a mere 2,210. Beginning in the 1600s, the largest island, Spitsbergen, served as a walrus-hunting and whaling hub for the English, Dutch, and French, and later was sparsely populated by Russian coal miners. During the Helmer Hanssen’s journey through the archipelago, we encountered the flotsam and jetsam of human activity: abandoned outposts and weather stations, the occasional brick—bright as a flare against the beige scenery—and, of course, lots and lots of plastic. But save for the persistent seabirds, we were completely alone.

            On the voyage’s first full day, Eilertsen selected a Ph.D. student named Teppo Rämä and I for a shore-picking voyage. Rämä’s work focuses on the antibiotic potential of fungi, and we would be scavenging the icy beach at the base of the island’s fjords in search of it. Mummified in my heavy, waterproof, yellow-and-blue Arctic suit, I joined Eilertsen, Rämä and a member of the ship’s crew in an outboard-powered skiff. As we ripped toward shore, a walrus surfaced near our little inflatable dinghy, and I was startled by the size and proximity of its huge, tusked head, a boulder rising from the water.

            When we reached land, I stumbled while dismounting from the skiff, and my phone fell from my pocket into the cold brine of the ocean, never to be seen again. We had already traveled above the horizon of the satellites that serve mainland Europe, so on the boat cell service was intermittent, announced only by the sudden pings of a slew of missed texts. Now, without even that tenuous link to civilization, I’d have to fully embrace the solitude of the Arctic.

            Ashore, Eilertsen and Rämä took off in different directions while I stayed near the armed crewman, mindful of the very real possibility of a polar-bear encounter. Though it was just after lunch, dusk had already fallen. We worked under the pink sky, crouching among frosted rocks and the logs washed up from Siberia, frozen but still fecund. Using his serrated paring knife, Rämä harvested a small, square sample from one of the beached logs, secured it in a Ziploc baggie, and moved down the frost-speckled beach.


            To travel so far, and into such inhospitable territory, on such slim hopes may seem foolish, but the need for new drugs, and particularly new antibiotics, is pressing. One recent study predicted that by 2050, if nothing is done to combat the global overuse of antibiotics and the resulting rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, infections will kill more people per year than cancer. The implications—for human life expectancy and for society as a whole—are so grim that experts refer to this future reckoning as “antibiotic winter.”

            On the silent Svalbard coast, Rämä and Eilertsen traipsed on, filling their baggies with algae scraped from logs and rocks. The beach was scattered with shin-high icebergs laced with holes; jellyfish lay on the sand like so many magenta lily pads. Later, I would ask Eilertsen how he and Rämä knew where to look, and exactly what they were looking for. Eilertsen tried to explain their methods, but acknowledged that they were heavily influenced by circumstances and their inability to control them. “Teppo, he’s looking for fungi on old driftwood, and it’s peculiar,” he said making a that crazy kid face. “But I mean, he could find gold. Who knows?”

            Onboard the Helmer Hanssen, the researchers rotated between sampling the ocean and sampling the food. Breakfast was an array of porridges and eggs, meats and cheeses, laid out like an unusually wholesome Vegas buffet. Lunch tended to be warm, hearty, and stew-like, a midday reward for engaging with the elements. By dinnertime, a feast even by land standards, I could usually manage only a small serving of lutefisk and whale meatballs before rolling off to sleep.

            After following the west coast of Svalbard for several days, we turned northwest toward Greenland and the open sea, heading for the Yermak Plateau. Though the Arctic Ocean is the world’s smallest, its depth can reach nearly 18,000 feet—more than three miles—in parts of the Arctic Circle, and a plateau on the ocean floor is a rare sampling opportunity. By the time we reached Yermak, the crew’s daily routine was well established: At 9 a.m., after breakfast, the entire group gathered in the instrument room, a communal space where a wall of monitors displayed various updates about the voyage, including a live video feed from the shelter deck where the hauls of ocean mud were raised. During the meeting, Eilertsen, outfitted in his cruise uniform—a black button-up shirt tucked into black chinos, with a baby-blue comb in his back pocket—went over the day’s schedule.

            The scuba divers, one each from Greenland, Norway, and Italy, had arguably the hardest jobs on the ship. Though the team used an underwater drone for initial surveys, retrieving specimens required humans, and most days the three men made multiple dives. Every few hours, the crew would also lower a dragging device—part bucket, part claw—from the back of the ship, dredge up a wheelbarrow’s worth of mud, and deliver it to the white plastic table and a group of waiting scientists.

            After the morning briefing, half of the crew members returned to their bunks for rest while the rest began a six-hour shift of sampling. At 2 p.m., the watches switched. The Helmer Hanssen had six decks, with bunks scattered among them. My bunk, located in the ship’s bow a floor above on the shelter deck, was a windowless nook with an enclosed bunk bed, a small locker and a plush chair with a foot-long table protruding from one wall. The mess, on the ship’s fourth floor or topgallant deck, was cozy and couch-lined, and every night after dinner, the scientists—one shift putting off going to bed, the other putting off starting to work—would allow themselves an interlude of tea drinking, knitting, and chitchat. During occasional spells of satellite service, we would watch Norwegian prime-time shows like Farmen, a reality show in which contestants are forced to live on a farm with no electricity or running water and compete in games like axe throwing.


            The bridge, a quiet, carpeted room ringed with windows, was a refuge from the engine noise and industrial chill that permeated the rest of the ship. It had books and binoculars, and its quiet was only occasionally broken by the crackle of the captain’s radio. The room was the perfect place for staring—by day into the infinite water, dotted with schools of dolphins and spouts of whales, and by night at the northern lights, whose vibrating glow consumed the sky. From the bridge, it was clear that our tiny vessel floated on an enormous ocean, and that the world wasn’t ours. Instead, we were just a few dozen creatures cast among countless others.

            ***

            Despite the depth and breadth of human ingenuity—our ability to accelerate particles, send men to the moon and rovers to Mars, produce lifesaving drugs, watch American Ninja Warrior via satellite TV on a boat within the Arctic Circle—it’s still difficult for us to outfox bacteria, which can duck, evade, and even fight back against our antibiotic attacks.

            One way to outwit bacteria is to sneak up on them incognito, disguising an existing antibiotic by slightly changing its structure. This technique is relatively inexpensive, but risks creating a drug that the target bacteria are already somewhat familiar with, increasing the likelihood of resistance. Another method involves finding completely novel molecules and turning them into drugs unfamiliar to at least some dangerous bacteria. But this practice, as the members of Marbio well know, can be dramatically more difficult. As Jeanette Andersen, the head of Marbio, told me, “you don’t know what you’re looking for.”

            The search for the unknown takes lots of time and lots of money: The cost of an average day aboard the Helmer Hanssen is about 200,000 Norwegian kroner, or $25,500. Funding comes into the Marbio lab in a variety of ways, including from the university, the Norwegian government, commercial partners and external grants. And trips must be made with regularity, as even frozen samples can degrade in the laboratory.

            After the Helmer Hanssen had returned to port, I visited the Marbio lab in Tromsø, where the team members were beginning to process the hundreds of samples from the trip. They screened each sample to determine its structural information, elemental composition and biological activity, then checked their data against international databases. Had they found a known compound? If so, they returned to their collection of new samples. Had they found a known compound with novel activity? If so, they studied it more closely. Had they found a novel compound with novel bioactivity? If so, their work had only begun. Though years of trial and error stood between the researchers and a new drug, there seemed to be no misgivings about the worthiness of the work.

            Since 2007, the Marbio team, participating in a project called MabCent, has spent more than a full year at sea and sampled from over 1,000 different locations around the Svalbard archipelago. They have collected 1,200 different species of invertebrates and hundreds of species of microalgae, totaling more than 3,000 pounds of organisms. And while the work has not yet led to any commercially available drugs, the team has made promising finds, such as a molecule, isolated from a sponge, that has strong antioxidant activity relevant to cancer and diabetes. So strong, in fact, that its effects are now being tested in mouse studies. And gradually, Marbio’s work is helping to narrow its search: Their sample analysis suggests, for example, that Arctic invertebrates have more potential for anticancer compounds, and that fungi are more likely to yield antibiotics.


            Bringing a new drug to market—discovering a new compound on land or sea and developing it into a pill ready to swallow—costs, on average, more than $2.5 billion, and takes about 10 years. Even given enough money and time, the odds of success are long: Of the drugs being developed worldwide that make it to clinical testing, only about 12 percent are approved for commercial sale. Antibiotics, which don’t command high prices and can be rendered useless by fast-evolving bacteria, are risky investments for drug manufacturers, who prefer to invest in the research and development of lifestyle drugs. A diabetes medication, meant to be taken every day for the rest of one’s life, is more profitable than an antibiotic created to be taken only in dire situations.

            As I walked down one of the lab’s sterile hallways with Andersen, she acknowledged that new drugs are by no means a complete solution to the antibiotic crisis. “I think it would be very naïve to think that we will solve everything by finding a new antibiotic, because we know that it will eventually develop resistance for that molecule,” Andersen said soberly. “But I think we should find new things, because there should be things in development that could be used as a last resort.”

            The voyage itself was full of improvisation: The Helmer Hanssen was forced to change course when conditions were unnavigable, and to move on when samples yielded nothing new or useful. The main purpose of our trip was to take advantage of a waning summer thaw to get farther north than typically possible, but when we reached 81.5 degrees latitude, less than 1 degree short of our objective, the team discovered that high winds had packed swirling pancakes of ice into a giant, nearly unbroken sheet. We stood on the deck in the purple Arctic glow, gazing out at an eerily wind-pocked ice field that disappeared into the sky at the horizon in a jewel-toned wash of light.

            In order to sample the ocean, the scientists would have to stand on the ice, which wobbled dangerously in the waves. I watched from the deck as the researchers descended to the ice via a rickety gangplank, using shovels to keep their balance and ladders to traverse the shifting floes.

            When they reached a fissure, some researchers lay on their bellies, scraping at the ice with small knives, while others jabbed at it with shovels, ad-libbing in the chaotic conditions. After about 45 minutes, the group returned with buckets and baggies of shaved ice, ready to be tossed into the ship’s walk-in lab freezer for preservation. But our stay so far north would be short-lived. The crew had decided that the ice would soon envelop the boat, making it impossible to retreat to open water. That night, the Helmer Hanssen turned southward, and Eilertsen began to plot a new course.

            Even though the team had not reached 82 degrees, no one seemed disappointed. The hit-or-miss nature of bioprospecting, and the rarity of a bonanza, generally tempered expectations.

            One night, over after-dinner cups of tea during our three-day straight shot across the open Arctic Ocean back to the Norwegian mainland, I asked Klara Stensvåg, a microbiologist, whether the trip had been a success.

            Shocked by the suggestion that it had not, Stensvåg folded over her phone’s pink leather cover and began scrolling through her pictures, pausing at an image of an orange ball covered in pimples. “This,” she said, gesturing at the blob. “We had wanted it for a couple of years and at Bjørnøya, we got it.” It was a sea squirt called Synoicum pulmonaria, known for its bioactivity against bacteria, and it had been on Stensvåg’s wish list for a long time. The team had only collected one on this voyage, but as Stevnsvåg said, “Even one is good.”


            Bjørnøya—“Bear Island”—halfway between Svalbard and mainland Norway, had not been on the original itinerary; only because of the unforeseen ice conditions had the team decided to make a stop. Stensvåg gazed at the image on her phone, zooming in on it, marveling at her luck. “It felt like an orange,” she said, recalling the moment when the divers, back from another chilly mission, presented her with the little ball.

            Any discovery in the ocean, I was learning, required both relentlessness and luck. At one point during one of our evening conversations in the instrument room, Eilertsen confessed, “To be honest, a full cruise can be a waste—but we don’t know that beforehand, so we must continue.” Though always useful in terms of gathering samples, not every trip yielded something novel. “It’s like a lottery ticket you must buy again and again.”

            ***

            Earlier in the trip, about a week after leaving Longyearbyen, we visited an island named Moffen, off the northwest tip of Svalbard. Flat and shaped like a corona, with a lagoon at its center, Moffen felt like a floating beach, barely breaking the surface of the ocean. In the 1700s, this particular island was a center of walrus slaughtering; by the middle of the 20th century, the walrus population around Svalbard was nearly extinct. In 1983, the Norwegian government protected the island as a sanctuary so that the walrus population could reestablish itself.


            Eilertsen insisted we all get off the boat and go ashore. He argued that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and besides, we needed the exercise. Once all 24 of us had shuttled to Moffen in the skiff, we scattered, as we were apt to do whenever released from the confines of the Helmer Hanssen. Pairs of scientists turned over rocks, or squatted and examined whale vertebrae the size of Frisbees. A small group of Ph.D. students inspected the frozen body of a dead duck. In the distance, I spotted two seesawing on one of the washed-up Siberian logs. Eilertsen urged us to hurry, which was difficult given that we were wearing our cumbersome survival suits, and full of another enormous Norwegian lunch. The wind gusted by like a passing train, eliminating conversation. We reached a field of walrus bones, the slaughtering ground from generations before. The bones were covered in soft algae, the first green I had seen in days.

“There’s something special about the ice,” one of the Ph.D. students had said to me early in the voyage. “The first time I came up here, I couldn’t sleep. I just stared at the ice.” Everyone who has traveled above 80 degrees latitude seems similarly enchanted. For many, the vast emptiness of the Arctic feels full of potential—of organisms still unknown, of limits not yet reached. That afternoon on Moffen, a place home to wild animals, I understood the spell. Our trip was only halfway over, but already I was missing the Arctic Ocean. The sea belongs to the creatures that swim beneath its surface, not the ones who temporarily float on top of it. But I knew there would be days in the future when I would wish for an excuse to return, to recapture that feeling of frozen expanse, of treasures yet to be found.

            We're going to appeal that. [WBC president] Mauricio Sulaiman said he would talk about it this week, and maybe post a resolution," Hearn exclusively told Sky Sports.

            Whyte has long been ranked No 1 by the WBC, owns their 'silver title, and consolidated that position by beating Lucas Browne in March, but was still overlooked in favour of No 2 ranked Breazeale.

            "I've had the sanctioning fights, I've done everything they have asked me to do," Whyte told Sky Sports last week. "My information was - I was meant to be next in line."

            Hearn added: "We don't mind fighting Ortiz but it has to be for the mandatory, not to be the 'second mandatory' behind a guy who has never fought an eliminator and who is behind Whyte in the rankings. It's outrageous."

            Anthony Joshua vs Wilder for all four major world heavyweight titles is "70 percent" likely to happen next, according to Hearn, who has held "positive conversations" this week.

            Joshua and Wilder's mandatory obligations would be postponed if a deal is agreed to crown an undisputed champion - but the queue of challengers is forming behind both.

            Hearn explained: "If Joshua doesn't fight Wilder, then Wilder will fight Breazeale. If Wilder fights Breazeale, he doesn't need to be the mandatory.

            "But Wilder's team will want Breazeale to be the mandatory because there isn't much credibility in the fight.

            "Everything is up in the air - but within the next 10 days all of those things will be a lot clearer."

            Whyte's setback with the WBC has opened doors with the IBF, who have ordered he fights Pulev for the opportunity to become mandatory challenger to the belt owned by Joshua.

            "It's a good fight. Dillian can become IBF mandatory and that's a good place for him to be," Hearn said.

            "[Promoter Kalle Sauerland] has Pulev and we're in extensive dialogue to make the fight.

            "I don't think me and Kalle have ever been to a purse bid - usually we make a deal!

            In the wake of Walmart’s intention to buy a controlling stake in Flipkart for $16 billion, eBay has announced that it is among the investors that will be selling its stake in the business, in eBay’s case for gross proceeds of $1.1 billion. And along with that, it said it plans to relaunch eBay India, focusing not on domestic sales as it had done previously, but on cross-border sales: selling into India from abroad, and from India to other markets.

            The short announcement doesn’t give too many details how it will progress on these future plans, but as part of it, eBay confirmed that it will be ending its strategic deal with Flipkart, which had included a license for Flipkart to use eBay.in and for the two companies to cross-promote products between the two platforms.

            “We plan to relaunch eBay India with a differentiated offer to focus initially on the cross-border trade opportunity, which we believe is significant,” the company noted in a statement. “We believe there is huge growth potential for e-commerce in India and significant opportunity for multiple players to succeed in India’s diverse, domestic market.”

            The announcement is not too surprising. India represents massive potential: the populous country is the second-biggest economy in Asia, and one of the fastest-growing globally, with a digitally-savvy population (35 percent of all Indians use the Internet, making it the second-biggest market in the world). In that regard, it would have been a surprise, and possibly a foolish choice, to retreat from India completely in the wake of Walmart’s acquisition.

            On the other hand, eBay has had a mixed track record when it comes to leveraging the market opportunity. In addition to its own site that it had sold to Flipkart, eBay was a repeat investor in Snapdeal, another e-commerce marketplace in the country that has fallen on challenging times amid fierce competition in the market. Snapdeal has in the last year laid off staff, struggled with finances and failed to close an acquisition deal with Flipkart.

            In a positive light, there is still a lot to play for, and by offering a differentiated opportunity focusing on cross-border sales, eBay could exploit a gap in the market that Walmart will not have the appetite to pursue. EBay doesn’t state this, but in an ideal world, it’s going into its plans with its eyes open, and based on purchasing patterns it’s been seeing in and out of the country in recent years.

            We’re contacting eBay to see if the company can give us more details and we’ll update this post as we learn more. when Mateias was sentenced to one year in prison over the World of Warcraft affair.

Or build your Android app in Android Studio and test it right on your laptop, thanks to the built-in support for Android apps that came to Chrome OS last year.

            The first preview of Linux on Chrome OS is now available on the Pixelbook, with support for more devices coming soon.

            Google’s  PM director for Chrome OS Kan Liu told me the company was obviously aware that people were using Crouton to do this before. But doing this also meant doing away with all of the security features that come with Google’s operating system. And as more powerful Chrome OS machines hit the market in recent years, the demand for a feature like this also grew.

            To enable support for graphical apps, the team opted to integrate the Wayland display server; from the user’s perspective, the actual window dressing will look the same as any other Android or web app on Chrome OS.

            Most regular users won’t necessarily benefit from built-in Linux support, but this will make Chrome OS machines even more attractive to developers — especially the more high-end ones like Google’s own Pixelbook. Liu stressed that his team spent quite a bit of work optimizing the virtual machine, too, so there isn’t a lot of overhead when you run Linux apps — meaning that even less powerful machines should be able to handle a code editor without issues.

            Now, it’s probably only a matter of hours before somebody starts running Windows apps in Chrome OS with the help of the Wine emulator.

        preview: "StubHub is best known as a destination for buying and selling event tickets. The company operates in 48 countries and sells a ticket every 1.3 seconds. But the company wants to go beyond that and provide its users with a far more comprehensive set of services around entertainment.",
        text: """
            To do that, it’s working on changing its development culture and infrastructure to become more nimble. As the company announced today, it’s betting on Google Cloud and Pivotal Cloud Foundry as the infrastructure for this move.

            StubHub  CTO Matt Swann told me that the idea behind going with Pivotal — and the twelve-factor app model that entails — is to help the company accelerate its journey and give it an option to run new apps in both an on-premise and cloud environment.

            “We’re coming from a place where we are largely on premise,” said Swann. “Our aim is to become increasingly agile — where we are going to focus on building balanced and focused teams with a global mindset.” To do that, Swann said, the team decided to go with the best platforms to enable that and that “remove the muck that comes with how developers work today.”

            As for Google, Swann noted that this was an easy decision because the team wanted to leverage that company’s infrastructure and machine learning tools like Cloud ML. “We are aiming to build some of the most powerful AI systems focused on this space so we can be ahead of our customers,” he said. Given the number of users, StubHub sits on top of a lot of data — and that’s exactly what you need when you want to build AI-powered services. What exactly these will look like, though, remains to be seen, but Swann has only been on the job for six months. We can probably expect to see more for the company in this space in the coming months.

            “Digital transformation is on the mind of every technology leader, especially in industries requiring the capability to rapidly respond to changing consumer expectations,” said Bill Cook, President of Pivotal . “To adapt, enterprises need to bring together the best of modern developer environments with software-driven customer experiences designed to drive richer engagement.”

            Stubhub has already spun up its new development environment and plans to launch all new ups on this new infrastructure. Swann acknowledged that they company won’t be switching all of its workloads over to the new setup soon. But he does expect that the company will hit a tipping point in the next year or so.

            He also noted that this over transformation means that the company will look beyond its own walls and toward working with more third-party APIs, especially with regard to transportation services and merchants that offer services around events.

            Throughout our conversation, Swann also stressed that this isn’t a technology change for the sake of it.

        category: .technologies,
        preview: "Last week, we reported on how Amazon was leveraging a new relationship with home builder Lennar to expand its smart home business, specifically in the sale of home security services.",
        text: """
            Today, Amazon is taking the next step forward in that strategy: it’s launching a new chain of showrooms it’s calling the Amazon Experience Centers across Lennar model homes to demo and help sell its smart home devices, Amazon Dash Buttons, and other consumer electronics services such as streaming Prime Content with Fire TV.

            The model homes will be fully connected up as Alexa-enabled smart homes, Amazon says, with customers able to walk through and see the full effect of being able to use Alexa to control all electronic and connected kit, from TVs and lights to thermostat and window blinds.

            These Experience Centers will also become places where people can go to arrange for and order home services through Amazon Home Services, the company’s Thumbtack-style marketplace that lets people search for and book a range of in-home contractors for cleaning, fixing or helping in other ways.

            The centers will open first in 15 model homes in the cities of Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington DC, and Amazon will be looking to strike deals with other home builders to replicate the model.

            The Experience Centers, and the other work that Amazon is doing to provide a more in-person angle to its smart home strategy specifically is particularly important to the company’s smart home and consumer electronics strategy. If people are buying products to put into their homes, and many of those products represent the next generation of consumer electronics, it’s important for Amazon to provide more real-world touchpoints both to better sell and explain the services, and to help make consumers — the majority of whom will not be early adopters — more comfortable with the purchases.

            “We wanted customers to experience a real home environment that showcases the convenience of the Alexa smart home experience, great entertainment available with Prime, and Home Services,” said Bhavnish Lathia, general manager, Amazon Services, in a statement. “We are excited to extend our relationship with Lennar with the launch of Amazon Experience Centers. As one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, Lennar offers the potential to enable this experience within easy driving distance of millions of customers.”

            The launch of these Experience Centers is also just the latest move by Amazon to bring its online marketplace and virtual salesrooms into more physical, brick-and-mortar environments. Other efforts have included Go, Amazon’s cashier-free shopping experience launched at the end of last year, and its university campus-based stores, which have been around now for several years. All of these also complement the major investment that Amazon has made in another physical sales environment: last year the company acquired the Whole Foods chain of supermarkets for $13.7 billion.

            As with the company’s home services specialists, the people who will staff the Experience Centers will also be employees of Amazon, “experts” in the company’s parlance, “employees who are specially trained on the latest technology and are passionate about helping customers.”

            For Lennar, the idea will be to use the format to help it sell more of its homes, as well as the premium packages to add on the numerous extras of making them into high-end smart homes. The company controversially once worked with Apple as its smart home partner but more recently swapped to working with Amazon, reportedly because Amazon sold not only its own devices, but those of third parties.

            “Amazon’s ability to bring a home to life with Alexa smart home experiences, entertainment and services – coupled with their obsession with customer experience – is a natural extension of our Everything’s Included approach to homebuilding,” said David Kaiserman, president of Lennar Ventures, in a statement. “We picked Amazon because of our shared commitment to customers, their Amazon experts across the country, and their ability to connect customers with thousands of service providers through Amazon Home Services.”

            Profits up 23% to $2.9bn (£2.14bn) beat analysts' forecasts, while revenue rose 9% year-on-year to $14.5bn.

            The increase was driven by the film and theme park units, which outshone a TV arm facing strong digital competition.

            The profits came amid questions about Disney's plan to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox's business.

            Disney last year announced it would buy certain Fox assets, including its film and television studios and its 39% stake in Sky, in a deal valued at more than $66bn, including debt.

            At the time, Disney boss Robert Iger said the purchase would help to supplement Disney's content as it plans to compete with the likes of Netflix by starting its own online subscription streaming sites.

            Mr Iger said Disney remains committed to the deal, which needs approval from regulators to move forward.

            He declined to comment on reports that Comcast, a major US pay-TV and internet provider, may be preparing a rival offer for Fox assets.

            Comcast had been interested in Fox last year, but was reportedly rebuffed in favour of Disney due to anti-trust concerns.

            Comcast last month made a formal £22bn offer for the UK broadcaster, challenging Fox's plans to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Disney had planned to become Sky's full owner if Fox's transaction went through.

            Moving online
            Mr Iger said Disney's digital plans, which are a response to rapidly falling cable television subscriptions, do not depend on Fox to move forward.

            The company has already launched its ESPN+ sports service and has invested in Hulu, a television and moving streaming site.

            The firm also plans to start a Disney-branded subscription service in late 2019 that will offer access to the company's significant film and television catalogue.

            BP, which owns the other half, is in the process of offloading its share to small North Sea specialist Serica, but that deal has not completed.

            BP does huge amounts of business in the US and will be desperately keen to avoid being seen as a business partner of the Iranian state.

            It's a good example of how sanctions against a state can have wide repercussions for the international business community.

            The chairman of Serica, Tony Craven-Walker, told the BBC he was still hopeful that the deal would close and that there would be no interruption to a major source of gas for UK families and businesses.

            However, one of the conditions of the deal closing is obtaining a licence to operate from the US Treasury Department, which is thrown into question with the imminent reintroduction of US sanctions against Iran.

            BP and Serica both said they had no plans to stop production in the short term.

            However, Serica conceded that it may have to change personnel and companies involved in the operation of the field to ensure there were no US individuals or entities involved.

            Cold snap
            UK gas supplies were shown to be very tight during the recent cold snap, when National Grid issued a gas deficit warning that resulted in some companies agreeing to cut their consumption to protect household supplies.

            Earlier this year, Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, said multinationals including Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total, Italy's ENI, Japan's Inpex and Malaysia's Petronas had submitted proposals to expand the Azadegan oil field near the Iraqi border.

            For those companies with significant business in the US - such as Shell and Total - those proposals may need to be shelved. Total is particularly exposed, as it has made significant investments in Iran.

            Meanwhile, the Department for International Trade said the government "continues to fully support expanding our trade relationship with Iran".

            However, it added this line that firms may not find totally reassuring: "How UK companies act in response to US sanctions is a commercial and legal decision for that company. Where necessary, legal advice should be sought."

            When the US decides it doesn't want to do business with a country, non-US companies can also get burned.

            In 2012, HSBC was forced to pay a $1.9bn US fine for breaching certain sanctions, including the one imposed on Iran. Standard Chartered paid a $400m fine for Iranian sanction-busting activity.

            Both HSBC and Standard Chartered did not re-enter the Iranian market after the original sanctions were lifted - a factor that many think held Iran's economy back over the last few years.

            In a globalised world, sanctions can have long tentacles. There is plenty to keep company lawyers busy as the details of this new sanctions regime become clear.

            The deal will allow Vodafone to expand its mobile, TV and broadband services in Hungary, Romania and Czech Republic.

            It will also create a stronger "quad play" competitor for Deutsche Telekom in Germany.

            The long-expected deal with Liberty Global, which also owns Virgin Media, is Vodafone's biggest since its £112bn takeover of Mannesmann in 2000.

            Vodafone said the transaction, which includes Unitymedia in Germany, would create a "converged national challenger" in the country.

            Deutsche Telekom, which is Europe's biggest telecoms operator by revenue and owns T-Mobile, has voiced strong objections to the move.

            Its chief executive, Timotheus Höttges, said it would distort competition: "I personally will fight for fair competition for our customers, to ensure that we do not face a disadvantage."

            He has also questioned whether regulators would approve the tie-up.

            However, Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said that deal "creates a strong competitor to Deutsche".

            Vodafone already owns the largest cable business in Germany after it acquired Kabel Deutschland for €7.7bn five years ago.

            Unitymedia is the second-largest cable network, operating in the three of Germany's 16 states that Vodafone does not already cover.

            Mr Colao said that there was "no geographical overlap" between the two businesses.

            Mike Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, said: "Even together, Liberty Global and Vodafone, whose cable networks don't compete or overlap, will be half the size of the incumbent operator. It's time to alter market dynamics by unleashing greater investment and competition."

            Vodafone offers only mobile services in Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic, but buying Liberty's cable business will allow to expand into TV and broadband in those markets.

            As part of the deal, the company will pay Liberty Global €10.6bn in cash, which the US business said would "provide significant additional flexibility to optimise growth and shareholder returns".

            Vodafone has also agreed to a €250m break fee if the acquisition does not complete.

            Richard Branson could bag a large profit on the sale of Virgin Money after receiving a £1.6bn bid for the bank seven years after he led a controversial £747m buyout of Northern Rock – later rebranded Virgin – following its taxpayer rescue.

            Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG), which has proposed the deal,said it would create “a genuine alternative to the large incumbent banks”. The enlarged group would have 6 million customers.

            Virgin Money shares climbed more than 9% to 341p on news of the CYBG approach, but a rise in the shares over recent days could interest City watchdogs. The shares climbed 15% from 270p to 312p last week.

            Banking analysts said the deal would present “compelling industrial logic”. It would bring together a more traditional bank, CYBG, which has 169 branches, mostly in Scotland and Yorkshire, and serves 2.8m commercial and personal customers, with Virgin Money’s strong brand in mortgages and credit cards business, which has 3.3m customers.

            Virgin Money has not yet agreed to the deal, which it described as a preliminary proposal, but its shares jumped 9% when the news emerged. Virgin Money shareholders would have 36.5% of the combined group.

            Virgin Money traces its origins back to the 1995 launch of Virgin Direct, an investment business, but it was the takeover of Northern Rock in 2011 that propelled it into a large-scale operation.

            As chancellor, George Osborne agreed to sell Northern Rock to Virgin Money nearly four years after nationalising the bank at the height of the financial crisis. The price paid by a consortium of investors, led by Branson, was half the amount the UK taxpayer had injected into bank. Osborne said at the time that the deal represented value for money for UK taxpayers.

            Branson’s consortium included the US billionaire, Wilbur Ross, now Donald Trump’s commerce secretary. It bought the “good” half of the bank, including its branch network, funded by retail deposits. The “bad” part of Northern Rock – which included its fabled 125% mortgages – remained in public hands, although defaults and losses have been much lower than anticipated.

            The coalition government brushed off calls by MPs, led by Chuka Ummuna, t.

            Virgin Money said in a statement: “The board of Virgin Money is in the process of reviewing this proposal. There can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made.”

            Shares in other mid-sized “challenger” banks rose sharply after CYBG’s prompted speculation that a long-awaited consolidation in the sector could become a reality.

            Virgin Money’s rivals, including Metro Bank and OnesavingsBank, rose as investors bet on which might be next to merge in a buoyant British mergers and acquisitions market which has had record levels of activity.

            Analysts said the initial offer was too low and would likely be rejected.

            “We think Virgin shareholders will be lukewarm on the proposal,” said John Cronin at the broker Goodbody, adding that he expected a protracted takeover battle as the two parties jockey over price.

            Under Takeover Panel rules CYBG now has until 4 June to table a formal proposal or walk away for at least six months.

        text: """
            Argentina has appealed to the International Monetary Fund for an emergency credit package in an effort to avoid a financial crash and rescue its faltering peso currency from a long downward slide against the dollar.

            The announcement, against a backdrop of surging interest rates and stubbornly resistant inflation, brought back echoes of Argentina’s monetary crash and foreign debt default in December 2001 when the peso dropped overnight to a quarter of its value against the dollar and bank accounts were frozen nationwide.

            “This will allow us to face the new global scenario and avoid a crisis like the ones we have faced before in our history,” the president Mauricio Macri said.

            Macri said international conditions had changed since he assumed office in December 2015. “During the first two years we have had a very favourable global context, but today that is changing, global conditions are becoming increasingly complex due to several factors: interest rates are rising, oil is rising, currencies of emerging countries have been devalued, all variables that we do not control.”

            Last week Argentina’s central bank raised interest rates from 33.25% to 40% in a bid to halt the slide in the peso.

            The Argentinian currency has been losing value against the dollar at a steady rate in the last few months, falling from under 20 pesos to the dollar to 24 pesos on Tuesday despite the latest rate rise. The peso has depreciated by 18% so far this year.

            Government sources quoted in Argentina suggested that Macri will be requesting $30bn from the IMF at below market interest rates. “It’s a large loan that justifies paying the political cost,” a government source was quoted as saying by the daily Clarín.

            Shoring up the value of the peso has proven a heavy drain on central bank reserves in the last months. “Going to the IMF at 4% is saving about half on the interest rate,” tweeted Elisa Carrió, head of the Civic Coalition party that forms part of Macri’s Cambiemos governing coalition. “This will allow us to be covered until 2019.”

            Other members of the coalition were less pleased by the announcement. “More than an agreement with the IMF, what is needed is an agreement between Argentinians,” said Ricardo Alfonsín of the Radical party. “I’m worried by the IMF’s conditions. With time, the remedy could prove worse than the disease.”

            Macri said he had spoken to IMF director Christine Lagarde in order to kick start negotiations for the loan.

            Cornered by lacklustre growth, rising retail prices, diminishing popularity and a smaller-than-expected soy harvest, Macri’s economic plan has been heavily dependent on foreign financing, which had dried up in recent months, prompting Tuesday’s appeal to the IMF for a line of credit.

            Last month the IMF reduced its growth forecasts for Argentina during 2018 from 2.5% to 2%. The government also seems unlikely to meet its projected inflation rate of only 15% for 2018, with the IMF predicting 19.2% instead.

            The rail industry is preparing for a cull in the number of fares and season tickets offered to commuters as it launches an appeal for root-and-branch reform of the “outdated” regulations underpinning the £9.7bn-a-year .

            Britain’s rail companies are beginning a public consultation into the rules underpinning the country’s ticketing options, which have ballooned in complexity to offer passengers about 55m different fares.


            
            The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), the trade body representing the firms that run Britain’s railways, said it was launching the UK-wide consultation alongside the watchdog Transport Focus because “decades of well-intentioned but outdated regulations have led to a range of fare options that have not kept pace with technology or how people work and travel today”.

            The pair are pledging to use their findings to “update fares regulation and make things easier for customers” but have ruled out recommendations that will lead to a .

            The industry will wait for the results of the consultation, which will run from June to September, before committing itself to any specific proposals.

            However, it has already cited its irritation with certain restrictions, including “inflexible seven-day, monthly or annual season tickets”, which must be offered to passengers under regulations that date back to the mid-1990s.

            Rail firms claim these restrictions make it impractical to offer more flexible “smart ticketing”, such as those implemented on the London Underground, where computer systems can calculate the most cost-effective ticket for different customers. They argue that the style of season tickets has become outdated because of more flexible working patterns.

            However, train tickets that would suit modern work patterns – such as a three-day-a-week season ticket – are too difficult to offer under current rules, train operators say.

            A spokesman for the RDG indicated that some fares might have to be scrapped in order to make way for new ones. “It doesn’t make sense to offer a three-or-four-day season ticket. There are certain fares that train companies have to sell. Unless we get rid of them, [new fares] keep adding to the total number.”

            According to research commissioned by the industry from the consulting group KPMG, only 34% of rail customers are “very confident” they bought the best-value ticket for their last journey and only 29% were “very satisfied” with the experience of buying their ticket. The industry says reforming the fares systems has the potential to attract more people to travel by train.

            Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus, said: “Rail passengers want a simpler, more understandable and modern fares system which matches the way we now travel. Opening up the debate and looking at the pros and cons of various reform options is welcome. Transport Focus will make sure the passenger voice is heard in these debates.”

            Jane Gratton, the head of business environment at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Businesses rely heavily on the rail network and will welxcome this long-overdue review of the fares and ticketing system. Increasingly confusing, frustrating and unfair, the current system needs to be brought in line with the more nimble and flexible way in which firms now operate. It’s the obvious next step to ensure people gain maximum benefit from the ongoing investment in our railways.”

            The regulations underpinning rail fares have remained unchanged from the mid-1990s, when the 1995 ticketing settlement agreement spelled out how fares should be set and sold.

            As it pre-dates widespread use of internet and smartphone technologies, the regulations assume that all customers will buy their ticket by visiting a ticket office and set out in detail how customers must be able to buy a ticket from each of the 2,500 stations in Britain to every other station in the country.

            A final report from the rail industry on the fare system is expected to be published in the autumn.

        text: """
            A spy camera in the Córdoba shop had recorded the woman eating a pasty while serving customers, violating the rules.
            The woman, not named, was sacked in November, having worked there for 12 years. She was unaware of the camera.
            A European ruling says firms must not use such recordings in dismissal cases.
            The Córdoba supermarket disciplined the worker because she had breached hygiene rules and had helped herself to a pasty - an empanadilla - on sale to the public.
            Her lawyer, Valentín Aguilar, says on his website (in Spanish) that the Córdoba court ruling is a legal first for Spain.

            In January, five other Spanish supermarket workers - all women - won a similar case at the European Court of Human Rights.
            Spanish courts had accepted covert video evidence from a supermarket chain, MSA, which accused the five of stealing items and helping co-workers and customers to do so.
            But the European Court in Strasbourg found that under Spanish data protection law the workers should have been informed that they were under surveillance. The spy camera violated their right to privacy, the judges ruled, in López Ribalda v Spain.
            In that case, the court ordered Spain to pay each of the five women €4,000 in damages, as well as €500 in costs to four, and €569 in costs to one.
            MSA had made them aware of visible cameras in the shop, but not of hidden cameras.

            Luigi Di Maio of Five Star and Matteo Salvini of The League have been given until Sunday to solve their differences.
            The prospect of a populist, Eurosceptic government has worried investors.
            But a deal would end political deadlock and the threat of another vote.
            The two leaders said in a joint statement they were aiming to "provide a response and a political government for the country as soon as possible". They have given no indication who would lead the government or what their policies will be.
            Mr Di Maio wrote on Facebook: "I cannot hide my joy and happiness that we can finally start solving Italy's problems".
            Once a programme is agreed, Five Star members are expected to have an online vote on it, in line with the movement's belief in direct democracy.

            President Sergio Mattarella, who had earlier given the parties until Thursday afternoon to reach a partnership deal, agreed to extend the deadline. But in a speech he appeared to warn them not to build a government that confronted the European Union and the euro.
            It would be a mistake, he warned, "to look to 19th-Century solutions when trying to solve the problems of the 21st Century".
            Italy's main FTMIB share index fell by more than 1% and government bond yields hit a seven-week high as the prospects of a populist coalition grew.
            What would a populist government mean for EU?
            By James Reynolds, BBC Rome correspondent
            In many ways, a Five Star-League coalition is a natural choice. Each party campaigned in the March general election as a populist, anti-system movement, wary of Italy's current relationship with the rest of the European Union.
            Five Star picked up votes by promising income support for the country's poor. The League wants to impose a 15% flat tax which would benefit companies.
            In order to fund these promises, the parties have each called for a renegotiation of the EU's strict fiscal rules.
            We don't yet know if the two parties, in coalition, will want to go further.
            Five Star has stepped back from an earlier promise to hold a referendum on the country's membership of the single currency.
            The League, which once promised to withdraw from the EU entirely, currently says it wants to reform the union from within.

            Why is Berlusconi important?
            Five Star has been open to taking part in a government with the nationalist League for some time, but always refused to work with Matteo Salvini's centre-right coalition ally, ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The centre-right coalition won the 4 March election without sufficient support for a majority, while Five Star was the biggest single party.

            The 81-year-old billionaire is considered corrupt by Five Star, and he has said the anti-establishment movement does "not have the political maturity" for government.
            Until President Mattarella abandoned attempts at forming a government earlier this week, threatening a "neutral" government run by technocrats, Mr Salvini had said he would not abandon Mr Berlusconi.
            Eventually, on Wednesday night, the former prime minister agreed not to stand in the way of a Five Star coalition with The League.
            However, he insisted his Forza Italia party would not back a confidence motion if they present a new government to parliament. They would not need his support as the two parties between them command over half the vote.

        text: """
            Within minutes, several police cars had arrived and the group was being questioned as a helicopter flew overhead. A neighbour who did not recognise them had called the police, suspecting they were burglars.

            They were in fact four creative professionals in town for an event. Now the three black people in the group are suing the Rialto Police Department, saying they were unfairly treated during the April 30 encounter.

            "Got surrounded by the police for being black in a white neighbourhood," one of the guests, Donisha Prendergast, a filmmaker and a granddaughter of Bob Marley, wrote on Instagram.

            "I'm sad and irritated to see that fear is still the first place police officers go in their pursuit to serve and protect, to the point that protocol supersedes their ability to have discernment."

            "We have been dealing with different emotions and you want to laugh about this but it's not funny," Kelly Fyffe-Marshall, another filmmaker, wrote on Instagram.

            "The trauma is real. I've been angry, frustrated and sad. This is insanity."

            Komi-Oluwa Olafimihan, an artist, pointed out that "over 700 people that look just like me did not walk away alive from a situation like this last year."

            The police and the renters offered different versions of events, but both recorded video: The police through their body cameras, the renters through their phones.

            Fyffe-Marshall said the officers came out of their cars, demanding that the group put their hands in the air. At first, the renters "joked about the misunderstanding," she said, but the situation escalated after 20 minutes when a sergeant arrived.

            The sergeant didn't know what Airbnb was, "insisted that we were lying about it and said we had to prove it," Fyffe-Marshall said. She showed the officers their booking confirmations and called the landlord, and the group was detained for 45 minutes, she said.

            She said the neighbour called the police because they had failed to wave at her.

            Fyffe-Marshall and Prendergast declined interview requests.

            The Rialto Police Department said in a statement that the group was questioned for 22 minutes and that officers had not used restraints on them. The officers learned they were Airbnb guests "through reasonable inquiry," and they were "immediately released without incident," the police said.

            "The Rialto Police Department is confident officers treated the involved individuals with dignity, respect and professionalism," the police said.

            Many people of colour have reported that police have been called on them while going about their everyday business, a fact of life that has seen several prominent examples in recent weeks.

            National outrage followed the arrest of two black men in a Philadelphia Starbucks; a group of black women had police called on them for golfing too slowly in York County, Pennsylvania; and two Native American brothers had a college visit in Colorado cut short when a parent told a 911 dispatcher that their behaviour and clothing was suspicious.

            Airbnb has for years been battling concerns over discrimination - though its focus had been on those renting out their homes, not neighbours. The company brought on prominent advisers, including Eric Holder, the former US attorney-general, to help form new policies, and released a 32-page report in 2016 on how it planned to fight discrimination.

            Airbnb said that what happened to the guests in Rialto was "unconscionable."

            Laura W. Murphy, a senior adviser, and Janaye Ingram, the head of national partnerships, sent a letter to Rialto's police chief and mayor Monday (May 7) to request a meeting.

            "We are deeply disturbed by the public reports suggesting that the police department's response was dictated by the guests' race," the two wrote.

            "As African-American women who have seen the inequitable treatment of people of colour, we know that these kinds of incidents are often rooted in implicit and explicit bias. They are hurtful, discriminatory, traumatic and must end."

            About 35 per cent of flight attendants taking part in the survey said they experienced verbal sexual harassment, including lewd, suggestive and inappropriate comments, in the past year alone.

            Eighteen per cent were physically harassed during the same period, reporting that they were "touched, felt, pulled, grabbed, groped, slapped, rubbed and fondled", on top of and under their uniforms, AFA said.

            Beyond its impact on the individual, such abuse threatens passengers' safety by undermining flight attendants' authority in emergencies and making it harder for them to intervene in disputes between passengers, the union said.

            The AFA called on the US airline industry to take steps to combat such harassment and acknowledge how it can affect safety.

            Sixty-eight per cent of the 3,500 flight attendants who took part in the survey said they have seen no efforts by airlines to address workplace sexual harassment in the past year, and only 7 per cent have reported such abuse. The study included employees of 29 US airlines.

            "Harassment of flight attendants is legendary, but this survey shows just how commonplace it remains even during the #MeToo era," Sara Nelson, the AFA president, said in a statement.

            "It's time for all of us - airlines, unions, regulators, legislators and passengers - to put a stop to behaviours that can no longer be condoned. The dignity and well-being of flight attendants and the safety of all travellers depend on it."

        text: """

            The reported exchange of fire came after weeks of rising tensions and followed US President Donald Trump's decision Tuesday to withdraw from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, a move Israel had long sought.

            The bombardment led to calls for calm from Russia, France, Germany and Britain and the European Union, while the United States put the blame squarely on Iran and stressed Israel's right to "self-defence".

            Germany and Britain joined the United States in denouncing the rocket fire towards the Israel-occupied Golan Heights they also said was carried out by Iran, while France reiterated its "unwavering support for Israel's security".

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had "crossed a red line" and that the resulting bombardment against targets in Syria "was a consequence".

            Iran's President Hassan Rouhani told German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a telephone call that he did not want "new tensions" in the Middle East.

            Rouhani did not mention of Israel's strikes in Syria, or those against the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

            But the chairman of his country's parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, Allaeddine Boroujerdi, condemned the strikes, warning that "Israel has entered a dangerous game".

            The Israeli raids in Syria, which a monitor said killed 23 fighters, were one of the largest Israeli military operations in recent years and the biggest such assault on Iranian targets, the Israeli military said.

            "We hit nearly all the Iranian infrastructure in Syria," said Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman.

            "I hope we've finished this episode and everyone understood." Israel carried out the raids after it said 20 rockets, either Fajr or Grad type, were fired from Syria at its forces in the Golan Heights at around midnight.

            It blamed Iran's Quds force, adding that Israel's anti-missile system intercepted four while the rest did not land in its territory.

            There were no Israeli casualties.

            If confirmed, it would be the first time Iran has sought to directly attack Israeli-controlled territory aside from an alleged attempted drone assault in February.

            'NEW PHASE'

            "We know that comes from the Al-Quds force," army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus said, referring to the special forces unit affiliated with Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.

            The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor reported that dozens of rockets were fired from Syria towards the Israeli-occupied Golan, without saying who fired them.

            It said the rockets followed a "first Israeli bombardment on the town of Baath" in Quneitra province.

            A senior pro-regime military source in Syria confirmed the salvo of rockets, insisting Israel had fired first.

            Later, in the early hours of the morning, explosions were heard in Damascus, while live images were broadcast on television showing projectiles above the capital and several missiles destroyed by anti-aircraft systems.

            Syrian state media said Israeli missile strikes had hit military bases as well as an arms depot and a military radar installation, without specifying where.

            The official Sana news agency said "dozens of missiles were shot down by anti-aircraft systems in Syrian airspace", acknowledging a number had reached their targets.

            Israel's military later confirmed it had carried out the raids, saying some 70 military and intelligence targets had been struck and all of its aircraft had returned safely.

            Syrian air defences, which fired dozens of times on Israeli jets, were also targeted, he said.

            Syria said it was the Israeli strikes that marked a "new phase" of direct involvement in the country's seven-year conflict.

            Its army said three people had been killed.

            In a rare if not unprecedented move for an Arab country, Bahrain backed Israel's right to "defend itself" after the strikes.

            RUSSIA HOTLINE

            Bahrain is a close ally of Saudi Arabia and the two countries, whose foreign policies are often in lockstep, view Iran as the chief threat to the region.

            Israel has long warned it will not accept Iran entrenching itself militarily in neighbouring Syria, where the Islamic republic is supporting President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the civil war.

            It has been blamed for a series of recent strikes inside Syria that have killed Iranians, though it has not acknowledged those raids.

            The Jewish state says it has conducted dozens of raids in Syria to stop what it says are advanced arms deliveries to Iran-backed Hezbollah, another key foe of Israel.

            Israel had been preparing itself for weeks for possible Iranian retaliation.

            Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal has added to tensions and led to a new level of uncertainty over how Iran will respond.

            On Wednesday, Netanyahu held talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country has provided massive military and diplomatic backing to Assad's regime.

            "I told President Putin that it is the right of every state, certainly the right of Israel, to take the necessary steps in order to protect itself from this aggression," Netanyahu said, referring to Iran's presence in Syria.

            Israel and Russia have established a hotline to avoid accidental clashes in the war-torn country.

            Russia was informed in advance of Israel's strikes, Conricus said.

            UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed for an "immediate halt to all hostile acts and any provocative actions to avoid a new conflagration in the region already embroiled in terrible conflicts with immense suffering of civilians," in a statement.

        preview: "A new meta-analysis of existing studies shows that a technique called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation might be a useful tool to help stroke survivors regain the ability to walk independently.",
        text: """
            Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique; magnetic coils are placed on a person's scalp, and short electromagnetic pulses are delivered to specific brain areas through the coil.

            Although these pulses only cause an almost imperceptible "knocking or tapping" sensation for the patient undergoing the procedure, they reach into the brain, triggering electric currents that stimulate neurons.

            rTMS has mainly been used to treat psychosis, depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders with a fair degree of success. In a recent study, more than one third of people living with auditory verbal hallucinations — a marker of schizophrenia — reported a reduction in their symptoms following the procedure.

            But researchers have also been delving into the potential that the technique has for improving life after stroke. Four years ago, for instance, a team of researchers at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus used rTMS to improve arm movement in people who had experienced a stroke, and more studies have explored this therapeutic potential since.

            Now, a team of researchers — jointly led by Dr. Chengqi He, of Sichuan University in the People's Republic of China, and Shasha Li, of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, both in Boston, MA — set out to review these studies.

            Dr. He and colleagues wanted to see if the technique improved motor skills for people who had stroke; to do so, the researchers examined the impact rTMS has on walking speed, balance, and other key factors for post-stroke rehabilitation.

            The findings were published in the American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, the official journal of the Association of Academic Physiatrists.


            rTMS 'significantly improves walking speed'
            Dr. He and team reviewed nine studies of rTMS — including five randomized controlled trials — which were published between 2012 and 2017.

            The people who participated in these studies had either had an ischemic stroke — that is, a stroke caused by a blood clot in one of the brain's arteries — or a hemorrhagic stroke — that is, one caused by bleeding within the brain.

            Of the nine studies, six included data on the walking speed of 139 stroke survivors. The researchers carried out a pooled analysis of these studies, and the results revealed that rTMS "significantly improves walking speed."

            This improvement was greater among people who received stimulation on the same side of the brain that the stroke occurred. By contrast, those who received rTMS on the opposite side did not see any improvement.

            Could saunas reduce stroke risk?
            Not everything that feels good is bad for you; regular sauna use may lower the risk of stroke.
            READ NOW
            Other key health outcomes for stroke survivors such as balance, motor function, or brain responsiveness did not show any improvement as a result of rTMS.

            In the United States, it is estimated that almost 800,000 people annually have a stroke, which makes the condition a leading cause of long-term disability in the country. More than half of the seniors who survived a stroke have reduced mobility as a result.

            Although the review shows that rTMS is a promising strategy for restoring independent walking, the authors say that more research is needed. Dr. He and colleagues conclude:

            "Future studies with larger sample sizes and an adequate follow-up period are required to further investigate the effects of rTMS on lower limb function and its relationship with changes in cortical excitability with the help of functional neuroimaging techniques."

            A collection of genes that encode different proteins found in many of our tissues and organs, our biological clocks regulate our circadian rhythms.

            These are behavioral and physiological changes that occur in response to the day and night cycle.

            More and more studies are now beginning to tie circadian rhythm disruptions to a variety of disorders.

            Alzheimer's, stress migraines, and cancer are a few of the illnesses that have been linked to a disrupted body clock or to faulty genes that regulate it.

            The link between cancer and circadian rhythms has increasingly become the focal point of medical research.

            A recent study, for example, revealed that two genes — called Bmal1 and Per2 — produce a cancer-promoting protein when "jetlagged." This, the researchers suggest, may explain why people who work night shifts are at higher risk of cancer.

            Now, a new study — conducted at the Texas A&M University in College Station — suggests that the same Per2 gene may have a protective effect against the formation of mammary tumors.

            The findings were published in the journal Development.

            The role of Per2 in our body clock
            The function of Per2, the authors of the new study explain, is to regulate the circadian rhythms found within each cell.

            Circadian rhythms are controlled by a "master clock" located in the brain. Specifically, the brain's hypothalamus hosts this central clock, which consists of over 20,000 neurons grouped in a structure known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

            Lead investigator Weston Porter, a professor at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, explains the function of Per2 within the larger mechanism of our body clock.

            He explains, "Not only do we have a central clock [the SCN], but every one of our cells has one of these peripheral clocks and they're in coordination with the central clock [...]."

            "When you wake up in the morning and see light," adds Prof. Porter, "the light goes right into the brain and it triggers this molecular mechanism that regulates the (circadian rhythm) process."

            Per2 — which is short for Period 2 — is responsible for encoding the "negative feedback" in this daily cycle, explain the researchers.

            Prof. Porter goes on to explain, "The negative and positive feedback mechanisms are constantly in balance, going up and down. One's up during the day, the other one's up at night — they oscillate right at 24 hours — but when you see light, that resets it in the morning."

            "When Per2 comes back, it suppresses another gene called BMAL or CLOCK," he adds.

            Per2 may keep breast cancer at bay
            Using a transplantation mouse model, Prof. Porter and colleagues determined an additional role of Per2 besides the timekeeping one. Suppressing Per2 in mice led to abnormally developed mammary glands in the rodents.

            As Prof. Porter goes on to say, "We discovered that these glands have what we call a kind of a bipotent phenotype; they're actually halfway to cancer. [They] already have many of the characteristics you would see in a premalignant cell."

            The gene, therefore, plays a key role in the differentiation and development of mammary gland cells. Also, most of the mammary tumors have a low Per2 expression — which, the scientists explain, suggests that the body clock gene may protect against breast cancer.

            "Per2 is functioning as a tumor suppressor gene associated with cell identity," says Prof. Porter. The lead investigator also shares some of his upcoming research.

            "Right now, we are investigating how our findings relate to humans," he says. "There are studies out there showing a relationship between decreased levels of Per2 and certain types of breast cancer, which are more invasive. So, we believe that there is a direct relationship."

        category: .health,
        preview: "Researchers suggest that we become more easily distracted as we age, and that it's all down to a part of our brains called the locus coeruleus. Could this advance our understanding of Alzheimer's disease?",
        text: """
            The "locus coeruleus" is a part of the brain stem that regulates the release of norepinephrine, a hormone linked to our level of attention and stress response.

            Under typical conditions, norepinephrine will stimulate the activity of already highly active neurons, while "silencing" less active ones.

            At a neural level, this helps us to stay focused and ignore distractions under conditions of stress.

            But as we age, it seems that we become more easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli, and even more so while in a situation that registers as stressful.

            Mara Mather and other researchers at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles decided to try to test whether older people are, in fact, less focused than younger people, and to find out why and how that happens.

            The new study — which has been published in the journal Nature Human Behavior — confirms that the older we get, the more difficult it becomes for us to stay focused in less than ideal conditions.

            "Trying hard to complete a task increases emotional arousal," explains Mather, "so when younger adults try hard, this should increase their ability to ignore distracting information."

            "But for older adults, trying hard may make both what they are trying to focus on and other information stand out more."

            Mara Mather
            She and her colleagues explain that this suggests that the locus coeruleus begins to function less effectively over time.

            A key locus in cognitive decline
            Mather's previous research also tied the locus coeruleus to something else: Alzheimer's disease. More specifically, this is where tangles of tau protein — which is a main characteristic of this neurodegenerative disease — first start to form in the brain.

            "Initial signs of this pathology," she says, "are evident in the locus coeruleus in most people by age 30."

            "Thus," Mather continues, "it is critical to better understand how locus coeruleus function changes as we age."

            So, for the purpose of the new study, the researchers worked with 28 younger adults, aged 18–34, and 24 older adults, aged 55–75, whose locus coeruleus activity and emotional arousal they monitored during a set of attention experiments.

            They did so using both brain scans and by assessing pupil dilation, which has been deemed a good indicator of locus coeruleus activity.

            Smooth communication in younger brains
            The tests consisted of showing the participants pairs of images: one featuring a building, and the other depicting a type of object. In some instances, the building was highlighted and the object appeared faded, and at other points it was the other way around.

            In each case, participants were asked to note which image was accentuated. But, in order to add an element of stress to the experiment, every now and again an announcement was made to the participants that they might receive an electric shock at the end of the exercise. At other times, though, an announcement would be made that no electric shock was forthcoming.

            It was revealed that in the case of the younger participants, when the picture of a building was highlighted, the stress of expecting a shock actually increased brain activity in an area called the "parahippocampal place area."

            This brain region gets its name from the fact that it is activated when we look at places and map out spaces.

            The same sort of brain activity decreased when they were shown unhighlighted images, indicating that the communication between the locus coeruleus, the parahippocampal place area, and the frontoparietal network — another brain structure tied to attention — ran smoothly, without any "hiccups."


            Older adults struggle to focus under stress
            The same did not hold true in the case of older study participants. Under conditions of stress — when expecting a mild electric shock — the older adults exhibited less intense activity of the frontoparietal network, even when looking at highlighted images.

            This, the researchers explain, suggests that the link between this brain network and the locus coeruleus may stop functioning so well later in life.

            At the same time, the older participants displayed increased activity in the parahippocampal place area in stressful conditions, regardless of whether they were looking at highlighted or faded images of buildings.

            This indicates that the younger adults' attention become more selective when they experienced emotional arousal, allowing them to focus only on the pictures that stood out.

            By contrast, in older adults, the parahippocampal place area "lit up" indiscriminately when they felt stress, suggesting that they were unable to focus on one prominent stimulus.

            These findings, the study authors note, provide another building block in our understanding of how cognitive functions change over time, and they may, in the future, help us to prevent neurodegeneration.

            "Deciphering exactly how these changes in the brain occur as we age could one day help us uncover how to protect the brain from cognitive decline and loss of function," concludes Mather.

        category: .health,
        preview: "Concussion does not have to result in loss of consciousness for it to be followed by a higher risk of developing dementia.",
        text: """
            This was the conclusion of a large study of veterans in the United States that found that the risk of developing dementia more than doubled following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) without loss of consciousness.

            The study, by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and now published in JAMA Neurology, addresses a gap in the evidence linking TBI with dementia.

            Other studies have shown that moderate and severe TBI are followed by a higher likelihood of developing dementia, but evidence of a link with mild TBI — particularly where no loss of consciousness occurs — was somewhat patchy.

            "There are several mechanisms," says senior study author Kristine Yaffe, who is a UCSF professor in neurology, psychiatry, and epidemiology and biostatistics, "that may explain the association between traumatic brain injury and dementia."

            Some have suggested that TBI triggers or speeds up the "accumulation of abnormal proteins" that kills brain cells, such as that which occurs in Alzheimer's disease.

            Others are of the view that TBI increases vulnerability to damage from further injuries or aging. But Prof. Yaffe reminds us that these are just theories and that "we need more work in this area."

            Mild TBI accounts for most TBIs
            A TBI is a blow, jolt, or bump to the head that causes disruption to normal brain function. Its severity depends on whether there is loss of consciousness, and the extent of any memory impairment, or altered mental status, and how long these changes last.

            Mild TBI, also known as concussion, accounts for most cases of TBI in the U.S.

            The researchers note that of the 2.8 million TBIs that occurred during 2013 in the U.S., around 80 percent were mild TBIs.

            They refer to a survey of men and women who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan that found that as many as 17 percent of personnel said that they had experienced mild TBIs in the field, of whom more than half reported having had more than one.

            The majority of these cases, note the authors, are caused by "shockwaves from blasts, rather than blunt trauma," and they are not necessarily accompanied by loss of consciousness.

            Study tracked more than 350,000 veterans
            For their study, the researchers used two sources of health information on U.S. veterans. One source was a database of "all-era" veterans whose TBIs could have occurred either during service or during their lives as civilians.

            The other database only contained records of veterans who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and most of the TBIs they detailed had occurred during military service.

            Altogether, they included 178,779 individuals diagnosed with TBI, with 54 percent having experienced mild TBI, or concussion.

            The researchers compared them with the same number of individuals with no history of TBI, bringing the total tracked by the study to more than 350,000 veterans.

            The average age of the veterans was 49, and the study followed them for an average of 4.2 years, noting any cases of diagnosed dementia. The vast majority of the vets were males, and nearly three quarters were white.

            More than double dementia risk
            The researchers found that, even after they had taken into account gender, race, age, and medical conditions that might affect the results, TBI was linked to an increased risk of dementia, as follows:

            Mild TBI without loss of consciousness was tied to a 2.36 times higher risk.
            Mild TBI with loss of consciousness was tied to a 2.51 times higher risk.
            Moderate to severe TBI was linked to a 3.77 times higher risk.
            The results were largely similar for the two sources of data, leading the team to conclude that mild TBIs that occur during military life are just as likely to have a link to dementia as those that occur in the population at large.

            The researchers believe that their findings show that more should be done to reduce the risks of brain injury.

            "In older adults," says first study author Deborah Barnes, who is a UCSF professor of psychiatry, epidemiology, and biostatistics, "exercise and multifactorial interventions may limit the risks of falls, which are a leading cause of head injury."

            In 2013, falls accounted for nearly half of all TBI visits to emergency departments, hospital admissions, and deaths in the U.S.

            In an accompanying editorial, Prof. Kimbra Kenney, from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Services in Bethesda, MD, and Prof. Ramon Diaz-Arrastia, of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, note that the large study is "the best information to date" to show that U.S. veterans face an increased risk of dementia as a result of being injured while serving their country.

            In the meantime, Prof. Barnes advises that you seek medical attention if you have a concussion and allow it "time to heal and try to avoid repeat concussions."

            "Although our study did not directly examine this issue, there is growing evidence that repeated concussions appear to have a cumulative effect."

        category: .health,
        preview: "Sometimes, the answer to a difficult problem may come from an unexpected direction. In this instance, researchers have found that a drug designed to treat osteoarthritis might also combat baldness.",
        text: """
            Hair loss can be incredibly distressing for men and women alike.

            Consequently, for many years, scientists have made efforts to find a way to combat it.

            Over the centuries, in the hunt for a hair loss cure, no path has been left untrodden — no matter how unusual.

            For instance, in Ancient Egypt, where premature baldness was thought to be a punishment from the gods, one remedy involved rubbing goat dung into the scalp.

            Because goats never lose their hair, this treatment was supposed to trick the gods into believing that the afflicted individual was, in fact, a goat.

            Thousands of years later, the options are still limited; there are now two available hair-loss drugs — minoxidil and finasteride — both of which have mixed results and some unpleasant side effects, including allergic reactions, erectile dysfunction, and, paradoxically, hair loss.

            The other option is hair transplantation surgery, which is costly, long-winded, and painful.

            Searching for a better option
            Dr. Nathan Hawkshaw and colleagues, from the University of Manchester's Centre for Dermatology Research in the United Kingdom, are involved in an ongoing search for a drug to fill this pharmaceutical void.

            On this quest, they assess existing drugs that are known to be well tolerated. They hope to find a compound that is already safe for human use that may also be useful in treating androgenetic alopecia, which is also known as male-pattern baldness (although it can affect women, too).

            One drug that piqued their interest was an immunosuppressive called cyclosporine A (CsA). It has been used to help prevent the rejection of transplants since the 1980s. And, one of CsA's side effects is unwanted hair growth.

            Dr. Hawkshaw took this as his starting point. If they could understand the mechanism at work, it might provide a novel approach to treating hair loss.

            Using isolated human scalp hair follicles, they found that CsA reduced the expression of a protein called SFRP1. This protein is known to inhibit the growth of tissues, including hair follicles.

            This explains why CsA promotes hair growth; it effectively takes the brake off of follicle activity. It also offers up a new mechanism to exploit.

            Dr. Hawkshaw sought an existing drug that would interact with this pathway and, potentially, encourage hair growth. After a long search, he came across WAY-316606, a drug originally designed to treat osteoporosis. WAY-316606 specifically targets SFRP1.

            To investigate whether the drug might work, the team experimented with donated human hair follicles from people undergoing hair transplantation.

            "Thanks to our collaboration with a local hair transplant surgeon, Dr. Asim Shahmalak, we were able to conduct our experiments with scalp hair follicles that had generously been donated by over 40 patients and were then tested in organ cultures."

            Using this tissue was important, as Dr. Hawkshaw explains, "This makes our research clinically very relevant, as many hair research studies only use cell culture."

            In fact, previous studies that had looked at the hair growth properties of CsA had drawn completely different conclusions.

            Dr. Hawkshaw explains, "When the hair growth-promoting effects of CsA were previously studied in mice, a very different molecular mechanism of action was suggested; had we relied on these mouse research concepts, we would have been barking up the wrong tree."

            Their results were published earlier this week in the journal PLOS Biology.

            Did it work?
            Application of the osteoporosis drug did indeed encourage new hair growth in the tissue samples. Dr. Hawkshaw believes that WAY-316606 might even outpace CsA, but without the unpalatable side effects.

            "The fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair loss context," he says, "promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: it could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss."

            Many people will greet this discovery with jubilation. However, before large clinical trials have been run, we should be cautious. The study was carried out in relevant human tissue, but, in real-life situations, drugs can respond in subtly different ways.

            Only time and research will tell, but the findings are a great start. Even if WAY-316606 does not cut the mustard, investigating related molecules might eventually come up with the goods.

        category: .health,
        preview: "Most of us know that without sleep, we are unable to create new memories. But is simply resting — without falling into the dreamy state — for only 10 minutes after learning something enough for us to memorize it in fine detail? Recent research suggests so.",
        text: """
            Sleep and memory are loving bedfellows. Sleep "blocks" our brain's mechanisms of forgetting, lowering the neurotransmitter dopamine, and therefore facilitating memory formation.

            Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that sleep is key for consolidating memories that we made while awake, as well as for preserving the brain's ability to learn new things in the future.

            For instance, a study revealed that during sleep, our synapses relax, staying supple and flexible, which maintains our brain's neuroplasticity and ability to learn.

            On the other hand, poor sleep leads to rigid synapses and an impaired ability to learn new things in the long run.

            Perhaps even more surprisingly, researchers have recently been able to interfere with the memory consolidation process that takes place during sleep by scanning people's brains, selectively choosing certain memories, and reinforcing them.

            But could a state of simple, restful wakefulness be just as beneficial for new memory formation? A new study — jointly conducted by Michael Craig, a research fellow at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, and Michaela Dewar, a research leader and assistant professor at the same university — suggests that it can.

            "Recent research," says Craig, "suggests that the memory system strengthens weak new memories by 'reactivating' them, where brain activity first observed during learning automatically reappears in the minutes that follow."

            Based on the findings of their own research, the scientists say, "This appears especially true during sleep and quiet resting, when we're not busy taking in any new sensory information."

            What's more, the new research suggests not only that a period of quiet restfulness helps us to remember new things, but that such a rest is crucial for retaining the fine details.

            The new findings were published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.

            Studying fine memories
            Craig and Dewar designed a memory test to assess the ability to retain finely grained information. They asked 60 young male and female participants — aged 21, on average — to look at a set of photos.

            They were asked to discern between "old" photos and "similar" ones. If the participants' ability to retain fine nuances was good, they would say the photos were "similar."



            "However," explains Craig, "if not-so-detailed memories are stored, people should miss the subtle differences in similar photos, and mistake them for 'old' photos."

            He goes on to summarize these "interesting" findings, saying, "Younger adults who quietly rested in the minutes that followed the photo presentation were better at noticing subtle differences in similar photos."

            This, he explains, suggests "that these individuals stored more detailed memories, compared to those who did not rest."

            "This new finding provides the first evidence that a brief period of quiet rest can help us to retain more detailed memories."

            Michael Craig
            He adds, "We think that quiet resting is beneficial because it is conducive to the strengthening of new memories in the brain, possibly by supporting their automatic reactivation."

            However, Craig admits that the mechanisms behind this surprising phenomenon remain a mystery.

            "[W]e don't know exactly," he goes on to conclude, "how this rest-related memory strengthening works. Specifically, it remained unknown whether quiet resting only allows us to retain more information, or whether it also helps us to retain more detailed memories."

            Astronomers are going gaga over Gaia.

            The April 25 release of data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia spacecraft, which cataloged nearly 1.7 billion stars, has kicked off a scientific spree, with multiple papers published online in the last two weeks at arXiv.org.

            Charting stars in the Milky Way and beyond, Gaia surveys the entire sky. The spacecraft can measure stars’ motions and distances (SN Online: 4/25/18), properties which haven’t been inventoried on such a large scale before. “It’s really opening new dimensions in how we view stars,” says astronomer Ana Bonaca of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.

            Because Gaia takes multiple images over time, “you're not only getting a static picture of the sky at one instant, you’re looking at how it changes,” says astronomer Laura Watkins of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “We’ve never really had something like this before.”

            Here are five new observations made with the unprecedented info.

            1. Sizing up the Milky Way
            Pinning down the mass of our home galaxy is a hefty challenge. Much of the Milky Way’s mass is hidden in the form of a dark matter halo, a shroud of matter that is invisible except for its gravitational pull. But scientists can gauge the galaxy’s unseen bulk by observing objects moving at the outskirts of the galaxy.

            Combining information from Gaia and the Hubble Space Telescope, Watkins and colleagues estimated the galaxy’s mass using the motions of clumps of stars called globular clusters. The Milky Way is about 1.7 trillion times the mass of the sun, the team reports in a paper submitted April 30.

            2. Rescaling exoplanets
            Exoplanet updates are also on the agenda. Because NASA’s exoplanet-hunting Kepler telescope has limited ability in gauging how big stars are, the diameters of exoplanets passing in front of those stars were not well known (SN Online: 6/19/17). “Gaia has now completely changed the game and solved this problem,” says astronomer Daniel Huber of the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

            Knowing both the brightness and distance of a star helps determine its size. So Huber and colleagues used Gaia’s data to better size up nearly 200,000 stars and more than 2,000 orbiting planets, the researchers report in a paper submitted May 1.

            3. Expanding a cosmic debate
            A disagreement over how fast the universe is expanding persists (SN Online: 1/16/18). Gaia data reinforced the discrepancy in results between two methods for measuring the expansion rate.

            One of those techniques involves estimating the distances of exploding stars, or supernovas, and measuring how their light is stretched by the expansion of space. Gaia improved distance estimates for variable stars called Cepheids, which scientists use to estimate how far away the supernovas are. The result: The expansion rate mismatch is now slightly worse, Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute and colleagues report in a paper submitted April 27.

            4. Dipping into star streams
            The Milky Way is a violent beast, ripping up clumps of stars and stretching them into strands known as stellar streams. Bonaca and astronomer Adrian Price-Whelan of Princeton University study the longest thin stream in the Milky Way, known as GD-1, in a paper posted May 1.

            Gaia’s measurements of stars’ motions, combined with information about their brightness and color from the Hawaii-based Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, or Pan-STARRS, allowed the duo to pinpoint which stars were going with the flow of the stellar stream. The data also revealed gaps where stars seem to be missing. That could indicate the stream was disturbed in the past by a close encounter with a clump of dark matter.

            5. Spotting speed demons
            Several teams used Gaia to pick out fast-moving stars, zipping through the galaxy at speeds of more than 1,000 kilometers per second. A team including Ken Shen of the University of California, Berkeley seized on this capability to look for clues to the origins of a kind of explosion called a type 1a supernova, thought to occur when a dead star known as a white dwarf explodes.

            Scientists don’t know exactly what causes a white dwarf explosion. In one theory, two white dwarfs swirl around one another as one steals material from the other. The thief eventually explodes and its partner is flung away at high speed.

            Shen and colleagues wasted no time in hunting for these fast-moving white dwarfs. Within an hour and a half of the Gaia data release, the team had the first of several ground-based telescopes taking a closer look at some of the speed demons. Three stars potentially fit the bill for coming from a type 1a supernova, the team reports in a paper submitted April 30.

            This is only the beginning of the Gaiapalooza, though. The data is so rich, Watkins says, “it’s going to take us months and years to get to grips with what’s there.”

        text: """

        For the first time, astronomers have charted the 3-D shape of a cloud of interstellar gas. The map explains why this cloud has failed to form stars so far, and could help test theories of how star formation works.

        Astrophysicists Aris Tritsis, now of the Australian National University in Canberra, and Konstantinos Tassis of the University of Crete in Heraklion, Greece, examined a narrow gas cloud in the constellation Musca, located between about 490 and 650 light-years from Earth. What looked like a narrow wisp of cloud that should have been condensed enough to make stars instead stretches 20 light-years away from Earth, the pair report in the May 11 Science.

        Such interstellar clouds are the primary birthplaces of stars and come in all sorts of blobby shapes. On the sky, the Musca cloud (sometimes called “the Dark Doodad Nebula”) looks like a long, thin snake about 26 light-years long. It has been “the poster child of a filament or cylindrical cloud,” says Tritsis, who studied the celestial wisp while at the University of Crete.

        The cloud’s apparent shape, however, posed a puzzle. If the object was really a cylinder, its mass should have been compressed enough to create stars. But the cloud shows no sign of star formation. Still, astronomical objects can be seen in only two dimensions on the sky. Previous observations of the orientation of light around Musca had suggested that the cloud might extend into space, but it was impossible to tell how deep it went just by looking at it.

        So the researchers decided to listen to the cloud instead, analyzing data taken by the Herschel Space Observatory of the cloud’s magnetic field. Wispy stripes called striations, which are formed by magnetic pressure waves — similar to sound waves — ripple through the cloud and bounce off of its edges. It’s like the whole cloud is singing, Tritsis says.

        The frequencies of these waves can reveal the size and shape of the object they’re ringing through. Musca’s waves exposed a nearly square sheet, extending about 20 light-years out into space away from Earth.

        “They found a way to measure this depth,” says astronomer Antonio Magalhães of the University of São Paulo, who was involved in earlier observations but not the new result. “They have a clever way to get this sheetlike structure.”

        That structure explains why Musca isn’t forming stars — its gas is spread out more than previously thought. The cloud could start forming stars sometime in the next 10 million years, Tritsis says.

        Many physical processes that affect when and how stars form, including magnetic fields, turbulence and gravity, are encoded in the shape of an interstellar cloud. So nailing down Musca’s true form could help refine scientists’ theories of how stars are born.

        “Musca can be used as a laboratory to find all this stuff,” Tritsis says.

        preview: "Whether underground cave-ins have made the facility unusable is unknown",
        text: """

        A new analysis of satellite images and seismic waves from North Korea’s nuclear test site support theories that the underground facility has at least partially collapsed.

        Seismologists across the world have been tracking the clandestine nuclear weapons program for years by analyzing vibrations that emanate from explosions at the test site under Mount Mantap (SN: 8/5/17, p. 18). Now, researchers have paired 3-D satellite images of Mount Mantap with seismic tremor data to simulate how the mountain’s interior might have changed after a hydrogen bomb test on September 3, 2017.

        The simulations indicate that the blast — which triggered an earthquake of estimated magnitude 6.3 — caused a cave-in directly above the detonation site, researchers report online May 10 in Science. The simulations also suggest that a second rock collapse, about 700 meters south of the detonation site, caused a smaller quake about eight minutes after the initial explosion.

        These rock falls, which caused the face of Mount Mantap to sink about 0.5 meters, could have buried part or all of the underground test facility, rendering it unusable, says study coauthor Teng Wang, a remote sensing and geodesy researcher at the Earth Observatory of Singapore.

        The results support another seismic analysis published online April 27 in Geophysical Research Letters suggesting an underground collapse at Mantap. That study led some media to speculate that North Korea didn’t pledge in April to halt nuclear testing because of international pressure, but because the test site could no longer be used.

        Ultimately, experts would have to inspect the site to confirm that the Mount Mantap facility is out of order, says study coauthor Douglas Dreger, an earth and planetary scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It’s really hard to make that judgment call without having information at that site — getting boots on the ground and investigating it.”

        preview: "The pandemic form of Bd chytrid likely emerged 50 to 120 years ago, a genetic study finds",
        text: """

        The biggest genetic study yet of a notorious frog-killing fungus says it probably originated in East Asia in the 20th century.

        The chytrid fungus nicknamed Bd, which attacks the skin, has astonished biologists in the last several decades by causing sudden, mass die-offs among frogs and other amphibians in Australia, Panama and other places worldwide. But where and when the killer emerged and how it spread have been much-debated mysteries. Studies have proposed North and South America as well as Africa and Asia as the homeland where a once-obscure fungus turned deadly.

        Building up enough genetic data to untangle the origins has taken some 10 years of field and lab work at about 35 institutions around the world, says infectious disease epidemiologist Simon O’Hanlon of Imperial College London. Analyzing the trove finds four main lineages of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and reveals that the worldwide killer group, BdGPL, probably originated 50 to 120 years ago, the researchers say.

        How the fungus traveled far and fast is less of a mystery. All the lineages show up in animals that have been traded internationally, often as exotic pets, the team reports in the May 11 Science.

        That’s “one of the parts I found most worrisome,” says longtime Bd researcher Karen Lips of the University of Maryland in College Park, who was not involved in the new study. International standards for pathogen monitoring are only as strong as their enforcement. “Here in the U.S. there is no requirement for testing of imports for chytrids,” she says.

        Spread of known lineages is only one of her worries. Mingling animals with different infections around the world could encourage current fungi to mate and create new forms. The new study has already found an example of one Bd hybrid.

        Bd may now be one of the most discussed fungal killers of animals in the world. It didn’t even have a name, however, when biologists were growing alarmed in the 1990s about amphibian declines and spooky die-offs. The fungus showed up now and then as researchers searched for the killer pathogen, but was dismissed at first as a skin fungus taking advantage of a dying animal. At the time, chytrids were mostly little-studied fungi that did little-known things in soils and water as far as the world’s small community of specialists knew. The idea of a chytrid, or any other fungus, causing an animal pandemic was odd.

        By the time researchers gave the newfound menace its official name in 1999, the killer lineage of Bd was spreading around the world. Various sleuthing efforts to backtrack its spread have yielded the far-flung possible origins as well as extremes of time; one study calculated that the deadly form had originated 26,400 years ago.

        In the new study, the team determined the arrangement of DNA building blocks in 177 individual samples of Bd from around the world, including the first ones available from Korea and Taiwan. Adding in some earlier collections, the new study draws on information from 234 individual samples.

        People who haven’t tried isolating one fungus’s DNA in full from wild amphibians underestimate the difficulty, O’Hanlon says. For instance, study coauthor Matthew Fisher of Imperial College London and colleagues caught and sampled about 500 amphibians during field work in French Guiana to score just three usable versions of full DNA in later lab work.

        Comparing the DNA samples let researchers rough out a genealogical tree with the four main Bd lineages, including a previously unknown one from Korea now dubbed BdASIA-1. For several reasons, that one appears to be the closest yet found to the original ancestor, the researchers propose. BdASIA-1 shows exceptional genetic variety, for example, something biologists expect from an original genetic pool that has sent out various emigrant versions. The Asian origin also fits with current thinking about the source of a sister chytrid, B. salamandrivorans, which is spreading into Europe and killing salamanders.

        Still, other places in East Asia might turn out to have Bd lineages that are even older than the Korean BdASIA-1, O’Hanlon says. There aren’t that many East Asian samples in the current database, and none at all come from India. This study may have corralled the most samples yet, but resolving the Bd origins mystery in detail is going to take even more.

        text: """

        Protons are no one-trick ponies. Although famous for their positive electric charge, the particles also carry an analogous, lesser-known charge, called the weak charge. Now, physicists have made the most precise measurement of the proton’s underdog attribute, members of the Q-weak experiment report in the May 10 Nature.

        The weak charge dictates how the proton responds to the weak nuclear force. Best known for its role in certain types of radioactive decay, the weak force is named for its feebleness compared with other forces such as electromagnetism (SN: 3/3/18, p. 11).

        In the experiment, located at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Va., scientists scattered beams of electrons off of protons in liquid hydrogen. The beams came in two different configurations, depending on a quantum property of the electrons called spin. In one setup, the electrons behaved as if spinning clockwise; in the other, counterclockwise. Observing the difference between how protons interacted with electrons of the two spin orientations let the team calculate the proton’s weak charge.

        The resulting charge is approximately 0.0719, a unitless number that agrees with predictions of the standard model of particle physics, the theory that describes how particles interact. That agreement partially rules out the existence of certain new types of particles, which is one reason scientists have been so interested in better understanding the proton’s weak side.

        Of course the guy’s wearing a full-body protective suit with face mask and goggles good and snug. He’s about to confront a nest of little fluffy caterpillars.

        Insect control can get surreal in the London area’s springtime battle against the young of oak processionary moths (Thaumetopea processionea).  The species, native to southern Europe, probably hitchhiked into England as eggs on live oak trees in 2005, the U.K. forestry commission says.

        Adults are just harmless mate-seeking machines in city-soot tones. But when a new generation’s caterpillars finish their second molt into a sort of preteen stage, their short barbed hairs (called setae) can prick an irritating, rash-causing protein into any overconfident fool who pokes them. Even people who’d never torment, or even touch, a caterpillar can suffer as stray hairs waft on spring breezes. (More on that below.)

        The caterpillars aren’t much for house cleaning. The baggy silk nest a group spins itself high in several kinds of oak trees accumulates cast-off skins still hairy with the toxic protein.

        The name processionary comes from the caterpillars lining up head-to-rump. “A column of caterpillars moving together like a train,” is how evolutionary biologist Jim Costa of Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, N.C., describes it. A little rearrangement can get processions trudging round and round in a circle.

        England’s ongoing battle against these oak leaf–stripping caterpillars has gripped the news, but other nations have irritating processions of their own, says entomologist Terrence Fitzgerald of State University of New York at Cortland. One of the London invader’s cousin, called a pine processionary moth (T. pityocampa), may be edging northward in Europe as the climate warms. In the United States, dark and spiky caterpillars of the buck moth Hemileuca maia show up largely unremarked in pockets in the East but are a traditional vexation of spring in New Orleans.


        Annoyances aside, these creatures represent part of the glorious but underappreciated social side of insects, Fitzgerald says. Ants, bees, wasps and termites have long been the social insects, but building joint nests and traveling in caravans are just some of caterpillars’ coordinated projects. If fish or birds did that, he grumbles, they’d be acclaimed as “fabulous animals.”

        Inspired by this rethink, Costa published “The Other Insect Societies.” Admittedly caterpillars, too young for sex anyway, don’t have the extreme reproductive specialty of a honeybee queen with a whole caste of sterile workers. But then people don’t either, and we certainly think we’re pretty social. — Susan Milius

        Another new home? TBS, which recently picked up the off-network rights to the cop comedy, and is overseen by Kevin Reilly, the former Fox president responsible for helping get the show, with stars Andy Samberg and Andre Braugher, on the air in the first place.

        It was a comedy bloodbath at Fox on Thursday, with the network canceling The Mick and Last Man on Earth in addition to B99, which ran for five seasons and was the network's highest rated live-action comedy in the adults 18-49 demo.

        Sheldon and Amy eventually made it down the aisle and brought Mark Hamill to full tears with their vows, which were truly something.

        "I can't imagine loving you more than I do right now, but I felt that way yesterday, and the day before yesterday, and the day before that," Amy said. "Sheldon, I don't know what the future holds, but I know that I've never been happier than I am in this moment, marrying you."

        Then it was Sheldon's turn.

        "Amy, I usually know exactly what to say, but in this moment, I have no words. I guess I'm overwhelmed by you, in a good way, not in the elevator in the Haunted Mansion way. Even if I can't tell you now how I feel, I will spend my life showing you how much I love you."

        Now, this is all very nice and good, but we'd like to take a minute to address a strange through-line in this episode and this show in general where the women do not care about things like Star Wars or the Avengers. Bernadette didn't even know which movie was the latest Avengers movie until Howard reminded her she slept through it, and Amy had little to no reaction to Mark Hamill officiating her wedding.

        Those are two of the biggest franchises in all of pop culture, especially at the current moment, and no longer really nerdy or niche pieces of pop culture. Women like them too, and Bernadette and Amy (and Penny!) should be allowed to enjoy them, or at least appreciate the fact that Mark Freakin' Hamill was crying at this wedding.

        Enjoying pop culture is fun! Everybody should get to do it!

        Anyway, congratulations to Sheldon and Amy. See ya in season 12!

        The dulcet tones of 2006's "Make This Go On Forever" were all we needed to start dissolving into a puddle of tears, alleviated only by the comatose April squeezing Jackson's hand and opening her eyes. She's alive, y'all. But she is not very well.

        April was in a car with ex-fiance Matthew when they got into an accident around a curve. Matthew was brought in first, and Owen had to go search for April. He found her nearly dead in a ravine, and Mer, Maggie, and Alex worked hard on her for hours to bring her back.

        Jackson learned what was happening about three hours into it and immediately ran to her side. Maggie eventually caught the tiniest rhythm and shocked her back to life, and the entire room went silent and prayed for her, because they knew that's what she would want.

        She was in a coma for a bit, but she eventually woke up and promised everyone she never even died for a second, because only Jesus can die and then come back to life.

        Matthew's bed was then wheeled in next to hers so they could recover together, and something tells us her exit from the show will be about starting a beautiful new life with her old love.
        Before all that went down, Arizona officially gave Bailey her two weeks and reunited with Dr. Herman (Geena Davis), who came in to have Amelia check her brain for any new tumors that might be causing some symptoms.

        But she was also there to tell Arizona that she had gotten a grant and planned to open up a maternal clinic, and she wanted Arizona to open it with her. Now, the plan is to open it in New York, somewhere near Callie and Sofia.

        Meanwhile, next week, it appears that April is fully recovered in time for Jo and Alex's wedding, but Jo and Alex get trapped in a shed! Hilarious...until that heartbreaking twist we're always fearing with this show.

        text: """
        The brooding ballad "Twice," released Friday, follows the Kanye West-produced "Accelerate," featuring 2 Chainz and Ty Dolla $ign. Aguilera tweeted she loves the song's "raw vocal quality," and she's especially proud of the "spiritual emotion and tone" it captures and conveys for her.

        "Well, you're no angel / I never asked you to be / You're my danger, 'cause that's just what I need / But it still hurts me," the five-time Grammy winner sings. "Well, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life / I found the price of love and lost my mind / I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights / I'd do it all again and won't think twice / Won't think twice."

        "Twice" is one of "many moods" expressed on Liberation, Aguilera added. The album, out June 15, features collaborations with Demi Lovato, Keida and Shenseea, and Aguilera worked with producers and songwriters such as Mike Dean, Julia Michaels, Anderson .Paak and Tayla Parx.

        "I don't know why we hurt ourselves to please someone else's perception of self. I'm sorry to my own reflection, I'm sorry for putting you down. I'm sorry I struggle accepting the beauty that lies in myself," Aguilera says in her album trailer. "I feel in life when you get to a place where you feel so comfortable and so routine then you know you have to stop and start from scratch."

        "The inspiration for the album? To me, the purest of reason is to get back to that little girl who just wants to be inspired again by truth and by that sense of passion for music and singing and just feeling free and alive again," says Aguilera, who released her last album, Lotus, in 2012. "I've stepped so far away from that little girl, and if that means going away for a little while and figuring out who you are again and what you need to say, then that's what you need to do."
        Aguilera, who will perform with Lovato at the Billboard Music Awards, is going on tour this fall.

        "Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls / Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls / Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls," the foursome chants in the chorus. "Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls / Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls."

        While the singers trade verses throughout the song, Cardi B's rhyme is quintessential Cardi B. "Now I could be your lipstick just for one night (one night) / Girls just wanna have fun, they have their funds right (yeah) / I mean, say my name, say my name, say my name (say my name)," the 25-year-old rapper says. "It tastes good just running up your tongue, right? (hurrr) / I put this smack on your lips all so pucker up (mwah) / We ain't never heard of you 'cause you ain't gun enough / And I don't gotta introduce myself (Cardi) / I'm too sexy, I seduce myself (Bardi) / Seven figure, never need a n---a (nope) / I steal your chick, have her down with the scissor / Tonight, I don't want a dog, I want a kitten / I might french your girls and break bread."
        For Ora, teaming up with the other women was a dream come true.

        "These past few years, I have been so inspired by all the strong women I've seen who aren't afraid to be themselves. For those who aren't afraid to rule the world, this is our anthem—a celebration of love," Ora said in a statement. The 27-year-old singer thanked "boss women" Cardi B, Rexha and Charli XCX for "each representing who they are and where they are from."

        Added Ora, "I hope you dance your socks off with us!"

        Rexha, who just had a No. 1 country hit, leapt at the chance to record a verse. "I've been so inspired by the powerful female singers of our time, and I couldn't be more proud to join Rita, Cardi and Charli in carrying on the tradition of bold, sexy and fearless expression," she said. "I strive to be a fierce champion of female empowerment and equal representation in music and beyond and am so excited to have this anthem out there in the world for girls everywhere."
        Likewise, Charli XCX was "instantly" down to work with Ora. "She's one of my favorite people I've met through music, a genuine person who is really funny and someone I count as a true friend. There's nothing more fun than making music with your friends," the singer said, adding, "I just want to throw a huge party when this song is out. Everyone's invited!"

        Ora will kick off her sold-out European Girls Tour in Glasgow on May 11.
