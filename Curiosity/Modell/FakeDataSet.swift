            Police removed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny from a rally in Moscow's Pushkin Square, carrying him off by his arms and legs.

            Officers used batons against protesters, with many in the crowd chanting "Putin is a thief!" and "Russia will be free!"

            Part of St Petersburg's famous avenue Nevsky Prospekt was blocked off by police as a crowd of roughly 1,000 demonstrators marched through the city.

            The country's interior ministry said about half of the 1,200 arrests happened in Moscow, but monitoring group OVD-Info put the number at more than 1,600 across 20 cities.

            Mr Putin's critics say he is more of a tsar than a democratic leader.

            Mr Navalny, who has been repeatedly detained and jailed for organising protests, published a message ahead of the marches saying: "If you think that he is not our tsar, take to the streets of your cities.

            "We will force the authorities, made up of swindlers and thieves, to reckon with the millions of citizens who did not vote for Putin."

            Mr Navalny called for rallies in more than 90 towns and cities, including   Moscow and St Petersburg.

            A Twitter account supporting Mr Navalny posted images from the protests, showing a stream of people waving Russian flags and carrying red balloons.

            The authorities regard most of the protests as illegal, arguing that their time and place was not agreed with them beforehand.

            One activist told a crowd in the city of Khabarovsk: "Putin has already been on his throne for 18 years! We've ended up in a dead end over these 18 years. I don't want to put up with this!"

            Mr Putin, 65, was re-elected in a landslide victory in March - extending his grip over the world's largest country until 2024. He will be inaugurated on Monday.

            He has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000.

            His victory makes him the longest-lasting leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, who ruled for nearly 30 years.

        text: """
            Shares in Apple, already the world's most valuable company, rose by almost 4% on Friday to more than $183.7 each.
            Mr Buffett said his Berkshire Hathaway group bought about 75 million more shares of the iPhone maker in the first three months of the year.
            His investment moves are closely watched across the world.
            Mr Buffett's company has been buying up shares in Apple since 2016. Berkshire Hathaway claimed a nearly 3.3% stake, or more than 166 million shares, at the end of last year.
            At the time, the holding, one of Berkshire's biggest stock market gambits, was worth more than $28bn.
            Now, after the additional share purchases and an 8% rise in price since the start of the year, the firm's stake is worth more than $44bn.
            Apple's market value now stands at almost $932bn.
            "It is an unbelievable company," Mr Buffett said in an interview with CNBC. "If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States."
            Some analysts have worried the technology giant's best days are behind it, as competition in the smart phone market increases and sales growth slows.
            But the company has been building up other lines of business, including the services unit that includes the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay.
            Apple this week reported profit of $13.8bn in the first three months of the year, rising 25% from the same period in 2017.
            The company also has a generous share buyback and dividend programme that is expanding.
            Apple, citing new US tax cuts, this week said it would buy back $100bn worth of shares and increase its dividend.
            The moves, which return money to its shareholders, had been widely anticipated in the aftermath of the new tax law, which lowered the corporate tax rate and reduced the incentives for firms to hoard cash overseas.
            Berkshire Hathaway will host its annual meeting for shareholders in Omaha, Nebraska this weekend.

            "I accept the consequences of this vote and will tender my resignation to the boards of Air France and Air France-KLM in coming days," he said.
            In a ballot, 55% of the French employees rejected the deal.
            Air France-KLM - one of Europe's biggest airlines - has seen a series of strikes in recent weeks.
            The industrial action has cost the Franco-Dutch alliance millions of euros.
            In the ballot, company employees rejected a 7% pay rise over the next four years.
            They have been demanding a 5.1% increase in 2018 instead - in a dispute that began in February.

            "This is an enormous mess that will only put a smile on the faces of our competitors," Mr Janaillac told a news conference.
            He said he hoped his departure would spark "a more acute collective awareness" before leaving without taking questions.
            The 65-year-old chief executive, who had been in the job for less than two years, earlier promised to quit if the pay deal was rejected.
            He had been trying to cut costs at the company, amid rising competition from low-cost airlines and Gulf national carriers.
            He will officially resign next Wednesday, Air France-KLM said.
            'Pain'
            Meanwhile, the company's unions said further strikes would be staged in the coming days.
            Air France-KLM has already downgraded its profit and growth expectations for 2018.
            Air France and KLM merged in 2004. They transport tens of millions of passengers around the world every year.
            Labour reforms launched by French President Emmanuel Macron have also led to strikes by employees of the state-owned SNCF rail company.
            British Airways and Lufthansa have already undergone deep cost-cutting in recent years, and some analysts say Air France has lagged behind.
            "There is inevitably some pain for staff when structural changes are made, but once that is dealt with, you're left with a much healthier company," said aviation consultant John Strickland.
            "That has been proved in the cases of the turnarounds achieved by Iberia and British Airways."

            Lehmann, 48, was cleared of any involvement in ball-tampering on the tour of South Africa.

            The governing body last week ruled that Whyte must fight Luis Ortiz in a "second mandatory" while Wilder's next mandatory opponent would be Dominic Breazeale.

            We're going to appeal that. [WBC president] Mauricio Sulaiman said he would talk about it this week, and maybe post a resolution," Hearn exclusively told Sky Sports.

            Whyte has long been ranked No 1 by the WBC, owns their 'silver title, and consolidated that position by beating Lucas Browne in March, but was still overlooked in favour of No 2 ranked Breazeale.

            "I've had the sanctioning fights, I've done everything they have asked me to do," Whyte told Sky Sports last week. "My information was - I was meant to be next in line."

            Hearn added: "We don't mind fighting Ortiz but it has to be for the mandatory, not to be the 'second mandatory' behind a guy who has never fought an eliminator and who is behind Whyte in the rankings. It's outrageous."

            Anthony Joshua vs Wilder for all four major world heavyweight titles is "70 percent" likely to happen next, according to Hearn, who has held "positive conversations" this week.

            Joshua and Wilder's mandatory obligations would be postponed if a deal is agreed to crown an undisputed champion - but the queue of challengers is forming behind both.

            Hearn explained: "If Joshua doesn't fight Wilder, then Wilder will fight Breazeale. If Wilder fights Breazeale, he doesn't need to be the mandatory.

            "But Wilder's team will want Breazeale to be the mandatory because there isn't much credibility in the fight.

            "Everything is up in the air - but within the next 10 days all of those things will be a lot clearer."

            Whyte's setback with the WBC has opened doors with the IBF, who have ordered he fights Pulev for the opportunity to become mandatory challenger to the belt owned by Joshua.

            "It's a good fight. Dillian can become IBF mandatory and that's a good place for him to be," Hearn said.

            "[Promoter Kalle Sauerland] has Pulev and we're in extensive dialogue to make the fight.

            "I don't think me and Kalle have ever been to a purse bid - usually we make a deal!

            "Different fights have different characteristics to the deal. [Pulev] does not have corporate sponsors, an international TV deal, or the levels of control of Joshua. So, it's just about the money."

            He has also paid $29,987 (£22,176) to Blizzard to cover the costs it racked up trying to repel the data deluge.

            Prosecutors in the case said the then 30-year-old had been motivated by a "juvenile desire" to beat his rivals.
            "Mateias, using his in-game avatar, often participated in collaborative events, such as 'raids' where players joined forces to meet game objectives and were rewarded with virtual proceeds or in-game advantages," explained the Department of Justice in a press release.
            "[He] became involved in disputes with other players for a variety of reasons, including the division of loot and membership in raid teams."
            Mateias - who is said to have used the online alias Dr Mengele, after the Nazi doctor who conducted deadly experiments on prisoners - had also faced charges over his alleged role in an effort to hack and rob California-based computer vendor Ingram Micro.
            However, prosecutors dropped the case when Mateias was sentenced to one year in prison over the World of Warcraft affair.

            Last year, eBay appeared to throw in the towel in India after it sold its business in the country to Flipkart and took a minority stake in the country’s e-commerce leader. Now, eBay is making a u-turn.

            In the wake of Walmart’s intention to buy a controlling stake in Flipkart for $16 billion, eBay has announced that it is among the investors that will be selling its stake in the business, in eBay’s case for gross proceeds of $1.1 billion. And along with that, it said it plans to relaunch eBay India, focusing not on domestic sales as it had done previously, but on cross-border sales: selling into India from abroad, and from India to other markets.

            The short announcement doesn’t give too many details how it will progress on these future plans, but as part of it, eBay confirmed that it will be ending its strategic deal with Flipkart, which had included a license for Flipkart to use eBay.in and for the two companies to cross-promote products between the two platforms.

            “We plan to relaunch eBay India with a differentiated offer to focus initially on the cross-border trade opportunity, which we believe is significant,” the company noted in a statement. “We believe there is huge growth potential for e-commerce in India and significant opportunity for multiple players to succeed in India’s diverse, domestic market.”

            The announcement is not too surprising. India represents massive potential: the populous country is the second-biggest economy in Asia, and one of the fastest-growing globally, with a digitally-savvy population (35 percent of all Indians use the Internet, making it the second-biggest market in the world). In that regard, it would have been a surprise, and possibly a foolish choice, to retreat from India completely in the wake of Walmart’s acquisition.

            On the other hand, eBay has had a mixed track record when it comes to leveraging the market opportunity. In addition to its own site that it had sold to Flipkart, eBay was a repeat investor in Snapdeal, another e-commerce marketplace in the country that has fallen on challenging times amid fierce competition in the market. Snapdeal has in the last year laid off staff, struggled with finances and failed to close an acquisition deal with Flipkart.

            In a positive light, there is still a lot to play for, and by offering a differentiated opportunity focusing on cross-border sales, eBay could exploit a gap in the market that Walmart will not have the appetite to pursue. EBay doesn’t state this, but in an ideal world, it’s going into its plans with its eyes open, and based on purchasing patterns it’s been seeing in and out of the country in recent years.

            We’re contacting eBay to see if the company can give us more details and we’ll update this post as we learn more. when Mateias was sentenced to one year in prison over the World of Warcraft affair.

            For the longest time, developers have taken Chrome OS machines and run tools like Crouton to turn them into Linux-based developer machines. That was a bit of a hassle, but it worked. But things are getting easier. Soon, if you want to run Linux apps on your Chrome OS machine, all you’ll have to do is switch a toggle in the Settings menu. That’s because Google is going to start shipping Chrome OS with a custom virtual machine that runs Debian Stretch, the current stable version of the operating system.

            It’s worth stressing that we’re not just talking about a shell here, but full support for graphical apps, too. That means you could now, for example, run Microsoft’s Linux version of Visual Studio Code right on your Chrome OS machine. Or build your Android app in Android Studio and test it right on your laptop, thanks to the built-in support for Android apps that came to Chrome OS last year.

            The first preview of Linux on Chrome OS is now available on the Pixelbook, with support for more devices coming soon.

            Google’s  PM director for Chrome OS Kan Liu told me the company was obviously aware that people were using Crouton to do this before. But doing this also meant doing away with all of the security features that come with Google’s operating system. And as more powerful Chrome OS machines hit the market in recent years, the demand for a feature like this also grew.

            To enable support for graphical apps, the team opted to integrate the Wayland display server; from the user’s perspective, the actual window dressing will look the same as any other Android or web app on Chrome OS.

            Most regular users won’t necessarily benefit from built-in Linux support, but this will make Chrome OS machines even more attractive to developers — especially the more high-end ones like Google’s own Pixelbook. Liu stressed that his team spent quite a bit of work optimizing the virtual machine, too, so there isn’t a lot of overhead when you run Linux apps — meaning that even less powerful machines should be able to handle a code editor without issues.

            Now, it’s probably only a matter of hours before somebody starts running Windows apps in Chrome OS with the help of the Wine emulator.

            StubHub is best known as a destination for buying and selling event tickets. The company operates in 48 countries and sells a ticket every 1.3 seconds. But the company wants to go beyond that and provide its users with a far more comprehensive set of services around entertainment. To do that, it’s working on changing its development culture and infrastructure to become more nimble. As the company announced today, it’s betting on Google Cloud and Pivotal Cloud Foundry as the infrastructure for this move.

            StubHub  CTO Matt Swann told me that the idea behind going with Pivotal — and the twelve-factor app model that entails — is to help the company accelerate its journey and give it an option to run new apps in both an on-premise and cloud environment.

            “We’re coming from a place where we are largely on premise,” said Swann. “Our aim is to become increasingly agile — where we are going to focus on building balanced and focused teams with a global mindset.” To do that, Swann said, the team decided to go with the best platforms to enable that and that “remove the muck that comes with how developers work today.”

            As for Google, Swann noted that this was an easy decision because the team wanted to leverage that company’s infrastructure and machine learning tools like Cloud ML. “We are aiming to build some of the most powerful AI systems focused on this space so we can be ahead of our customers,” he said. Given the number of users, StubHub sits on top of a lot of data — and that’s exactly what you need when you want to build AI-powered services. What exactly these will look like, though, remains to be seen, but Swann has only been on the job for six months. We can probably expect to see more for the company in this space in the coming months.

            “Digital transformation is on the mind of every technology leader, especially in industries requiring the capability to rapidly respond to changing consumer expectations,” said Bill Cook, President of Pivotal . “To adapt, enterprises need to bring together the best of modern developer environments with software-driven customer experiences designed to drive richer engagement.”

            Stubhub has already spun up its new development environment and plans to launch all new ups on this new infrastructure. Swann acknowledged that they company won’t be switching all of its workloads over to the new setup soon. But he does expect that the company will hit a tipping point in the next year or so.

            He also noted that this over transformation means that the company will look beyond its own walls and toward working with more third-party APIs, especially with regard to transportation services and merchants that offer services around events.

            Throughout our conversation, Swann also stressed that this isn’t a technology change for the sake of it.

            Last week, we reported on how Amazon was leveraging a new relationship with home builder Lennar to expand its smart home business, specifically in the sale of home security services. Today, Amazon is taking the next step forward in that strategy: it’s launching a new chain of showrooms it’s calling the Amazon Experience Centers across Lennar model homes to demo and help sell its smart home devices, Amazon Dash Buttons, and other consumer electronics services such as streaming Prime Content with Fire TV.

            The model homes will be fully connected up as Alexa-enabled smart homes, Amazon says, with customers able to walk through and see the full effect of being able to use Alexa to control all electronic and connected kit, from TVs and lights to thermostat and window blinds.

            These Experience Centers will also become places where people can go to arrange for and order home services through Amazon Home Services, the company’s Thumbtack-style marketplace that lets people search for and book a range of in-home contractors for cleaning, fixing or helping in other ways.

            The centers will open first in 15 model homes in the cities of Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington DC, and Amazon will be looking to strike deals with other home builders to replicate the model.

            The Experience Centers, and the other work that Amazon is doing to provide a more in-person angle to its smart home strategy specifically is particularly important to the company’s smart home and consumer electronics strategy. If people are buying products to put into their homes, and many of those products represent the next generation of consumer electronics, it’s important for Amazon to provide more real-world touchpoints both to better sell and explain the services, and to help make consumers — the majority of whom will not be early adopters — more comfortable with the purchases.

            “We wanted customers to experience a real home environment that showcases the convenience of the Alexa smart home experience, great entertainment available with Prime, and Home Services,” said Bhavnish Lathia, general manager, Amazon Services, in a statement. “We are excited to extend our relationship with Lennar with the launch of Amazon Experience Centers. As one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, Lennar offers the potential to enable this experience within easy driving distance of millions of customers.”

            The launch of these Experience Centers is also just the latest move by Amazon to bring its online marketplace and virtual salesrooms into more physical, brick-and-mortar environments. Other efforts have included Go, Amazon’s cashier-free shopping experience launched at the end of last year, and its university campus-based stores, which have been around now for several years. All of these also complement the major investment that Amazon has made in another physical sales environment: last year the company acquired the Whole Foods chain of supermarkets for $13.7 billion.

            As with the company’s home services specialists, the people who will staff the Experience Centers will also be employees of Amazon, “experts” in the company’s parlance, “employees who are specially trained on the latest technology and are passionate about helping customers.”

            For Lennar, the idea will be to use the format to help it sell more of its homes, as well as the premium packages to add on the numerous extras of making them into high-end smart homes. The company controversially once worked with Apple as its smart home partner but more recently swapped to working with Amazon, reportedly because Amazon sold not only its own devices, but those of third parties.

            “Amazon’s ability to bring a home to life with Alexa smart home experiences, entertainment and services – coupled with their obsession with customer experience – is a natural extension of our Everything’s Included approach to homebuilding,” said David Kaiserman, president of Lennar Ventures, in a statement. “We picked Amazon because of our shared commitment to customers, their Amazon experts across the country, and their ability to connect customers with thousands of service providers through Amazon Home Services.”

            Profits up 23% to $2.9bn (£2.14bn) beat analysts' forecasts, while revenue rose 9% year-on-year to $14.5bn.

            The increase was driven by the film and theme park units, which outshone a TV arm facing strong digital competition.

            The profits came amid questions about Disney's plan to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox's business.

            Disney last year announced it would buy certain Fox assets, including its film and television studios and its 39% stake in Sky, in a deal valued at more than $66bn, including debt.

            At the time, Disney boss Robert Iger said the purchase would help to supplement Disney's content as it plans to compete with the likes of Netflix by starting its own online subscription streaming sites.

            Mr Iger said Disney remains committed to the deal, which needs approval from regulators to move forward.

            He declined to comment on reports that Comcast, a major US pay-TV and internet provider, may be preparing a rival offer for Fox assets.

            Comcast had been interested in Fox last year, but was reportedly rebuffed in favour of Disney due to anti-trust concerns.

            Comcast last month made a formal £22bn offer for the UK broadcaster, challenging Fox's plans to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Disney had planned to become Sky's full owner if Fox's transaction went through.

            Moving online
            Mr Iger said Disney's digital plans, which are a response to rapidly falling cable television subscriptions, do not depend on Fox to move forward.

            The company has already launched its ESPN+ sports service and has invested in Hulu, a television and moving streaming site.

            The firm also plans to start a Disney-branded subscription service in late 2019 that will offer access to the company's significant film and television catalogue.

            The Rhum gas field in the North Sea, which supplies 5% of the UK's gas, is half-owned by the Iranian State Oil Company.

            BP, which owns the other half, is in the process of offloading its share to small North Sea specialist Serica, but that deal has not completed.

            BP does huge amounts of business in the US and will be desperately keen to avoid being seen as a business partner of the Iranian state.

            It's a good example of how sanctions against a state can have wide repercussions for the international business community.

            The chairman of Serica, Tony Craven-Walker, told the BBC he was still hopeful that the deal would close and that there would be no interruption to a major source of gas for UK families and businesses.

            However, one of the conditions of the deal closing is obtaining a licence to operate from the US Treasury Department, which is thrown into question with the imminent reintroduction of US sanctions against Iran.

            BP and Serica both said they had no plans to stop production in the short term.

            However, Serica conceded that it may have to change personnel and companies involved in the operation of the field to ensure there were no US individuals or entities involved.

            Cold snap
            UK gas supplies were shown to be very tight during the recent cold snap, when National Grid issued a gas deficit warning that resulted in some companies agreeing to cut their consumption to protect household supplies.

            Earlier this year, Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, said multinationals including Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total, Italy's ENI, Japan's Inpex and Malaysia's Petronas had submitted proposals to expand the Azadegan oil field near the Iraqi border.

            For those companies with significant business in the US - such as Shell and Total - those proposals may need to be shelved. Total is particularly exposed, as it has made significant investments in Iran.

            Meanwhile, the Department for International Trade said the government "continues to fully support expanding our trade relationship with Iran".

            However, it added this line that firms may not find totally reassuring: "How UK companies act in response to US sanctions is a commercial and legal decision for that company. Where necessary, legal advice should be sought."

            When the US decides it doesn't want to do business with a country, non-US companies can also get burned.

            In 2012, HSBC was forced to pay a $1.9bn US fine for breaching certain sanctions, including the one imposed on Iran. Standard Chartered paid a $400m fine for Iranian sanction-busting activity.

            Both HSBC and Standard Chartered did not re-enter the Iranian market after the original sanctions were lifted - a factor that many think held Iran's economy back over the last few years.

            In a globalised world, sanctions can have long tentacles. There is plenty to keep company lawyers busy as the details of this new sanctions regime become clear.

            The deal will allow Vodafone to expand its mobile, TV and broadband services in Hungary, Romania and Czech Republic.

            It will also create a stronger "quad play" competitor for Deutsche Telekom in Germany.

            The long-expected deal with Liberty Global, which also owns Virgin Media, is Vodafone's biggest since its £112bn takeover of Mannesmann in 2000.

            Vodafone said the transaction, which includes Unitymedia in Germany, would create a "converged national challenger" in the country.

            Deutsche Telekom, which is Europe's biggest telecoms operator by revenue and owns T-Mobile, has voiced strong objections to the move.

            Its chief executive, Timotheus Höttges, said it would distort competition: "I personally will fight for fair competition for our customers, to ensure that we do not face a disadvantage."

            He has also questioned whether regulators would approve the tie-up.

            However, Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said that deal "creates a strong competitor to Deutsche".

            Vodafone already owns the largest cable business in Germany after it acquired Kabel Deutschland for €7.7bn five years ago.

            Unitymedia is the second-largest cable network, operating in the three of Germany's 16 states that Vodafone does not already cover.

            Mr Colao said that there was "no geographical overlap" between the two businesses.

            Mike Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, said: "Even together, Liberty Global and Vodafone, whose cable networks don't compete or overlap, will be half the size of the incumbent operator. It's time to alter market dynamics by unleashing greater investment and competition."

            Vodafone offers only mobile services in Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic, but buying Liberty's cable business will allow to expand into TV and broadband in those markets.

            As part of the deal, the company will pay Liberty Global €10.6bn in cash, which the US business said would "provide significant additional flexibility to optimise growth and shareholder returns".

            Vodafone has also agreed to a €250m break fee if the acquisition does not complete.

            Shares in Vodafone rose 1.2% to 210.1p in morning trading in London.

            Richard Branson could bag a large profit on the sale of Virgin Money after receiving a £1.6bn bid for the bank seven years after he led a controversial £747m buyout of Northern Rock – later rebranded Virgin – following its taxpayer rescue.

            Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG), which has proposed the deal,said it would create “a genuine alternative to the large incumbent banks”. The enlarged group would have 6 million customers.

            Virgin Money shares climbed more than 9% to 341p on news of the CYBG approach, but a rise in the shares over recent days could interest City watchdogs. The shares climbed 15% from 270p to 312p last week.

            Banking analysts said the deal would present “compelling industrial logic”. It would bring together a more traditional bank, CYBG, which has 169 branches, mostly in Scotland and Yorkshire, and serves 2.8m commercial and personal customers, with Virgin Money’s strong brand in mortgages and credit cards business, which has 3.3m customers.

            Virgin Money has not yet agreed to the deal, which it described as a preliminary proposal, but its shares jumped 9% when the news emerged. Virgin Money shareholders would have 36.5% of the combined group.

            Virgin Money traces its origins back to the 1995 launch of Virgin Direct, an investment business, but it was the takeover of Northern Rock in 2011 that propelled it into a large-scale operation.

            As chancellor, George Osborne agreed to sell Northern Rock to Virgin Money nearly four years after nationalising the bank at the height of the financial crisis. The price paid by a consortium of investors, led by Branson, was half the amount the UK taxpayer had injected into bank. Osborne said at the time that the deal represented value for money for UK taxpayers.

            Branson’s consortium included the US billionaire, Wilbur Ross, now Donald Trump’s commerce secretary. It bought the “good” half of the bank, including its branch network, funded by retail deposits. The “bad” part of Northern Rock – which included its fabled 125% mortgages – remained in public hands, although defaults and losses have been much lower than anticipated.

            The coalition government brushed off calls by MPs, led by Chuka Ummuna, t.

            Virgin Money said in a statement: “The board of Virgin Money is in the process of reviewing this proposal. There can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made.”

            Advertisement

            Shares in other mid-sized “challenger” banks rose sharply after CYBG’s prompted speculation that a long-awaited consolidation in the sector could become a reality.

            Virgin Money’s rivals, including Metro Bank and OnesavingsBank, rose as investors bet on which might be next to merge in a buoyant British mergers and acquisitions market which has had record levels of activity.

            Analysts said the initial offer was too low and would likely be rejected.

            “We think Virgin shareholders will be lukewarm on the proposal,” said John Cronin at the broker Goodbody, adding that he expected a protracted takeover battle as the two parties jockey over price.

            Under Takeover Panel rules CYBG now has until 4 June to table a formal proposal or walk away for at least six months.

        text: """
            Argentina has appealed to the International Monetary Fund for an emergency credit package in an effort to avoid a financial crash and rescue its faltering peso currency from a long downward slide against the dollar.

            The announcement, against a backdrop of surging interest rates and stubbornly resistant inflation, brought back echoes of Argentina’s monetary crash and foreign debt default in December 2001 when the peso dropped overnight to a quarter of its value against the dollar and bank accounts were frozen nationwide.

            “This will allow us to face the new global scenario and avoid a crisis like the ones we have faced before in our history,” the president Mauricio Macri said.

            Macri said international conditions had changed since he assumed office in December 2015. “During the first two years we have had a very favourable global context, but today that is changing, global conditions are becoming increasingly complex due to several factors: interest rates are rising, oil is rising, currencies of emerging countries have been devalued, all variables that we do not control.”

            Last week Argentina’s central bank raised interest rates from 33.25% to 40% in a bid to halt the slide in the peso.

            The Argentinian currency has been losing value against the dollar at a steady rate in the last few months, falling from under 20 pesos to the dollar to 24 pesos on Tuesday despite the latest rate rise. The peso has depreciated by 18% so far this year.

            Government sources quoted in Argentina suggested that Macri will be requesting $30bn from the IMF at below market interest rates. “It’s a large loan that justifies paying the political cost,” a government source was quoted as saying by the daily Clarín.

            Shoring up the value of the peso has proven a heavy drain on central bank reserves in the last months. “Going to the IMF at 4% is saving about half on the interest rate,” tweeted Elisa Carrió, head of the Civic Coalition party that forms part of Macri’s Cambiemos governing coalition. “This will allow us to be covered until 2019.”

            Other members of the coalition were less pleased by the announcement. “More than an agreement with the IMF, what is needed is an agreement between Argentinians,” said Ricardo Alfonsín of the Radical party. “I’m worried by the IMF’s conditions. With time, the remedy could prove worse than the disease.”

            Macri said he had spoken to IMF director Christine Lagarde in order to kick start negotiations for the loan.

            Cornered by lacklustre growth, rising retail prices, diminishing popularity and a smaller-than-expected soy harvest, Macri’s economic plan has been heavily dependent on foreign financing, which had dried up in recent months, prompting Tuesday’s appeal to the IMF for a line of credit.

            Last month the IMF reduced its growth forecasts for Argentina during 2018 from 2.5% to 2%. The government also seems unlikely to meet its projected inflation rate of only 15% for 2018, with the IMF predicting 19.2% instead.

        preview: "UK-wide consultation to study outdated ticketing rules that have ballooned in complexity",
        text: """
            The rail industry is preparing for a cull in the number of fares and season tickets offered to commuters as it launches an appeal for root-and-branch reform of the “outdated” regulations underpinning the £9.7bn-a-year .

            Britain’s rail companies are beginning a public consultation into the rules underpinning the country’s ticketing options, which have ballooned in complexity to offer passengers about 55m different fares.


            
            The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), the trade body representing the firms that run Britain’s railways, said it was launching the UK-wide consultation alongside the watchdog Transport Focus because “decades of well-intentioned but outdated regulations have led to a range of fare options that have not kept pace with technology or how people work and travel today”.

            The pair are pledging to use their findings to “update fares regulation and make things easier for customers” but have ruled out recommendations that will lead to a .

            The industry will wait for the results of the consultation, which will run from June to September, before committing itself to any specific proposals.

            However, it has already cited its irritation with certain restrictions, including “inflexible seven-day, monthly or annual season tickets”, which must be offered to passengers under regulations that date back to the mid-1990s.

            Rail firms claim these restrictions make it impractical to offer more flexible “smart ticketing”, such as those implemented on the London Underground, where computer systems can calculate the most cost-effective ticket for different customers. They argue that the style of season tickets has become outdated because of more flexible working patterns.

            However, train tickets that would suit modern work patterns – such as a three-day-a-week season ticket – are too difficult to offer under current rules, train operators say.

            A spokesman for the RDG indicated that some fares might have to be scrapped in order to make way for new ones. “It doesn’t make sense to offer a three-or-four-day season ticket. There are certain fares that train companies have to sell. Unless we get rid of them, [new fares] keep adding to the total number.”

            According to research commissioned by the industry from the consulting group KPMG, only 34% of rail customers are “very confident” they bought the best-value ticket for their last journey and only 29% were “very satisfied” with the experience of buying their ticket. The industry says reforming the fares systems has the potential to attract more people to travel by train.

            Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus, said: “Rail passengers want a simpler, more understandable and modern fares system which matches the way we now travel. Opening up the debate and looking at the pros and cons of various reform options is welcome. Transport Focus will make sure the passenger voice is heard in these debates.”

            Jane Gratton, the head of business environment at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Businesses rely heavily on the rail network and will welcome this long-overdue review of the fares and ticketing system. Increasingly confusing, frustrating and unfair, the current system needs to be brought in line with the more nimble and flexible way in which firms now operate. It’s the obvious next step to ensure people gain maximum benefit from the ongoing investment in our railways.”

            The regulations underpinning rail fares have remained unchanged from the mid-1990s, when the 1995 ticketing settlement agreement spelled out how fares should be set and sold.

            As it pre-dates widespread use of internet and smartphone technologies, the regulations assume that all customers will buy their ticket by visiting a ticket office and set out in detail how customers must be able to buy a ticket from each of the 2,500 stations in Britain to every other station in the country.

            A final report from the rail industry on the fare system is expected to be published in the autumn.

        category: .science,
        preview: "Astronauts hoping stay on the moon for long-term missions have another reason to worry about moon dust: It could be quite harmful if inhaled, as demonstrated in a new study.",
        text: """
            We’ve long known that moon dust could cause trouble. During the Apollo missions, astronauts complained of sneezing and watery eyes after tracking dust from their spacesuits back into their ships. Scientists need to take moon dust and rocks into account when designing lunar landing equipment because it sticks to everything.

            No mice or humans were sent to the moon for this new study. Instead, scientists grew both human cells and mouse cells in the lab and exposed both to a simulated lunar dust. In both cases, the moon dust could kill the cell or damage the cells’ DNA.

            “Very small particles in the breathable range or smaller can interact directly with cells,” study author Bruce Demple, a professor at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine, told Gizmodo.

            Moon dust isn’t like Earth dust. Without weather or an atmosphere, the lunar soil is dry and potentially electrostatically charged, according to the paper published last month in GeoHealth. And billions of years of bombardment from meteorites and micrometeorites may have pulverized it into teeny pieces.

            The research is limited since it used mock moon dust, both crushed and uncrushed—it’s hard to get your hands on the real thing. And the cells were grown in a culture, rather than inside living creatures. But this work confirms older research that suggests moon dust could be hazardous to health.

            The simulated dust killed cells and altered DNA, especially right after it had been crushed up into smaller, micrometer-scale pieces. But there were surprises too: The dust’s chemical reactivity, measured in its ability to create reactive oxygen species (a kind of molecule you might call a free radical) had nothing to do with how likely it was to cause damage. Basically, it’s unclear why the dust was harmful—perhaps it had something to do with the shape of the pieces, suggested Demple.

            Now that the researchers have demonstrated danger with the simulated dust, they hope they’ve made enough of a case to acquire some real lunar dust from NASA that was recovered from the Apollo missions, Demple said.

            After all, if we’re going back to the moon, we should at least know what long-term exposure will do to astronauts’ health.

        category: .entertainment,
        preview: "Pascal Boyart is using QR codes to fuel his street art with Bitcoin donations",
        text: """
            We have come a long way since the times artists depended on the patronage of kings and queens for their financial stability. But while galleries and art dealers have mostly replaced this ancient system, a new breed of crowdfunded services like Patreon and Ulule are now lending even more fiscal independence to cash-strapped artists.

            Despite this liberating disruption in the artist-patron dynamic, such services pose the same risk to the financial security of creatives as the old patronage system, the revised art dealership model capitalism brought, and the crowdsourced funding alternative facilitated by the recent technological boom. Namely, that the artists are in a chronic threat of having their streams of income severed – at the drop of a hat.

            But thanks to blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies, creatives might have a new viable option to make ends meet without leaving their fiscal stability in the hands of profit-oriented dealers and corporations. Meet French street artist Pascal ‘PBOY’ Boyart.

            Boyart recently attracted the attention of the cryptocurrency community after one of his pieces made its way to the top of the Bitcoin discussion board on Reddit.

            Indeed, numerous Redditors flocked to salute him for his witty use of QR codes as a way of funding his work with Bitcoin donations from inspired passers-by.

            Influenced by the the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin, Boyart has made cryptocurrencies and decentralization a central theme in his work. In his paintings, Bitcoin becomes not only an integral part of the piece itself, but also the very method by which Boyart can profit from his creation.

            The QR codes are both his statement against the dangers of central censorship and his weapon of liberation.

            In this sense, his artistic fascination with the technology is two-fold: it explores how cryptocurrencies are gradually challenging the status quo of central authorities and simultaneously puts this playful exploration to the test.

            This, precisely, is the conundrum Boyart addresses in his mural of esteemed Dutch painter Rembrandt (whose life was marked by severe financial hardships despite his undeniable talent).

            But while it was the Rembrandt piece that brought the recognition of Reddit to Boyart, it wasn’t the first time the artist had experimented with incorporating Bitcoin donation addresses in his work.

            “I first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017,” Boyart told Hard Fork. “I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father ‘Dad, what is money?’ and I placed a QR code at the side of my signature.”

            I wasn’t sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations,” the artists added. “I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos’ book The Internet of Money.”

            Since then, Boyart has received over $1,000 (approximately 0.11 BTC) in donations so far, according to stats from the Bitcoin blockchain explorer.
        
            Boyart first got acquainted with Bitcoin in early 2014, but it took him four years to grasp the promise the technology behind it.

            “I didn’t understand it,” the artist told Hard Fork. “I thought it was a new PayPal.”

            “It was last May when I became really passionate about this new paradigm of money… I was thinking about all the best use cases artists can do with it,” Boyart continued. “It can free us from institutions and galleries.”

            “The most interesting aspect is decentralization – a peer-to-peer horizontal system,” he added. “Art and creation need that, I believe.”

            “My street art costs me a lot of money in materials and painting,” Boyart said. “But instead of funding alternatives like [crowdfunding platform] Ulule, I wanted a solution that offers direct financial relation with the people.”
“Bitcoin is perfect for this,” he added.

         category: .world,
         preview: "Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general who rose to prominence as an antagonist of the Trump administration, abruptly resigned on Monday night hours after The New Yorker reported that four women had accused him of physically assaulting them.",
         text: """
            “It’s been my great honor and privilege to serve as attorney general for the people of the State of New York,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. “In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me.

            “While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time. I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.”

            His resignation represented a stunning fall for a politician who had also assumed a prominent role in the #MeToo movement.

            Two of the women who spoke to the magazine, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, said they had been choked and hit repeatedly by Mr. Schneiderman. Both said they had sought medical treatment. Another woman, a lawyer, said she was slapped violently across the face. A fourth woman said she had similar experiences.

            All the women in the article, who had been romantically involved with Mr. Schneiderman, said the violence was not consensual.

            But not long after the allegations were made public, many of his allies, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who like Mr. Schneiderman is a Democrat, called for him to step down.

            “My personal opinion is that, given the damning pattern of facts and corroboration laid out in the article, I do not believe it is possible for Eric Schneiderman to continue to serve as attorney general,” Mr. Cuomo said.

            The call was echoed by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who led the charge to oust Al Franken from the Senate. “The violent actions described by multiple women in this story are abhorrent,” she said in a statement. “Based on this extensive and serious reporting, I do not believe that Eric Schneiderman should continue to serve as attorney general.”

            Under New York’s Constitution, Mr. Schneiderman’s replacement will be selected by the State Assembly and Senate by joint ballot — effectively placing the decision in the hands of the Assembly, which has many more members.

            The Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, planned to discuss possible replacements on Tuesday, according to Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Mr. Heastie. Whoever is chosen to fill out Mr. Schneiderman’s term could then seek election in November.

            No Democrat had declared an intention to challenge Mr. Schneiderman, who was up for re-election this year, in the primary; Manny Alicandro, a corporate lawyer from New York City, is running as a Republican and officially declared his candidacy on Monday.

            Since 2017, Mr. Schneiderman had raised his profile nationally by taking on President Trump’s agenda repeatedly in the courts. He was pushing to change state law so that his office could prosecute Mr. Trump’s aides even if the president pardoned them; his resignation makes the status of that effort less certain.

            Women’s issues had also been a focal point for Mr. Schneiderman, who had announced, for instance, a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. “We have never seen anything as despicable as what we’ve seen right here,” Mr. Schneiderman said then.

            Ms. Manning Barish, in The New Yorker account, described being slapped by Mr. Schneiderman after they had both been drinking; she and Ms. Selvaratnam said several of the attacks occurred after alcohol had been consumed.
    
            “It was horrendous,” she said. “It just came out of nowhere. My ear was ringing. I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed. I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him. I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down. He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me. The choking was very hard. It was really bad. I kicked. In every fiber, I felt I was being beaten by a man.”

            Debra S. Katz, a lawyer for Ms. Manning Barish, said that it was Mr. Schneiderman’s “fantasy and his fantasy alone that the behavior was welcome.”

            Mr. Schneiderman, she continued, “has made a career railing against this type of abuse. Yet apparently he intends to revictimize these courageous women who have come forward by pulling out that age old sexist trope that they wanted it.”

            Ms. Selvaratnam told the magazine that Mr. Schneiderman routinely drank to excess during their relationship, and that the physical abuse in bed got worse the longer she was with him. “We could rarely have sex without him beating me,” she said.

            The abuse was also verbal and emotional, she said. “He started calling me his ‘brown slave’ and demanding that I repeat that I was ‘his property.’”

            Both Ms. Manning Barish and Ms. Selvaratnam have in recent days repeatedly declined to comment when reporters for The New York Times asked them to address the allegations.

            “After I found out that other women had been abused by Attorney General Schneiderman in a similar manner many years before me, I wondered, who’s next, and knew something needed to be done,” Ms. Selvaratnam said in a statement released Monday night. “So I chose to come forward both to protect women who might enter into a relationship with him in the future but also to raise awareness around the issue of intimate partner violence.”

            Ms. Manning Barish followed the article’s publication with a post on Twitter, saying that she “could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me.”

            Mr. Schneiderman’s former wife said she was taken aback by the allegations being leveled against him.

            “I’ve known Eric for nearly 35 years as a husband, father and friend,” said Jennifer Cunningham, his ex-wife and frequent political strategist. “These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values and a loving father.”
    
            Mr. Schneiderman has long been regarded as one of the state’s most progressive politicians, even before his 2013 lawsuit against Trump University and his subsequent suits against the Trump administration made him the darling of the political left. Last fall, Mr. Schneiderman’s office proudly pointed to a segment on the late-night comedy show “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee,” in which the attorney general was described as “a hero who stood up to democracy’s nemesis,” a Superman-like character known as Schneider-man.

            His credentials as an advocate for women, in particular, had gone unquestioned.

            In 2010, as a state senator from Manhattan, he introduced a bill to make intentional strangulation to the point of unconsciousness a violent felony. That same year, the National Organization for Women’s New York branch endorsed him in his successful bid for attorney general, citing his “unmatched work” in “protecting women who are victims of domestic abuse.”

            For several years, his office has published a “Know Your Rights” brochure for victims of domestic violence. “We must recognize that our work keeping New Yorkers safe from domestic violence is far from over,” Mr. Schneiderman said in the announcement for the 2016 brochure.

            At the direction of Governor Cuomo, he was reviewing the 2015 decision by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein after an Italian model accused him of groping her.
            Mr. Vance’s office released a statement late Monday, saying that it had “opened an investigation into the recently reported allegations concerning Mr. Schneiderman.”

            Some national Republicans were gleeful at the allegations. The Republican research shop America Rising quickly packaged Mr. Schneiderman’s ties to other prominent national Democrats.

            Also on Monday evening, Mr. Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. dug up an old tweet from Mr. Schneiderman in which he said, “No one is above the law” and tweeted at him, “You were saying???”

On Monday afternoon, a criminal defense lawyer from Lankler Siffert & Wohl advised Mr. Scheiderman as he sought to respond to The New Yorker, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Later in the day, one of Mr. Schneiderman’s associates contacted several other law firms in an effort to retain a lawyer to represent him in connection with the criminal investigation, according to several people briefed on the matter.

            Ahmed Alsanawi might have as much insight into what makes a modern footballer a star as anyone, so when the Premier League's must-see barber starts talking about successors to David Beckham in the world of Premier League football, it's wise to take note.

            "David Beckham probably started this whole thing," Alsanawi tells Bleacher Report, "but I'd say Paul Pogba has replaced him. Anything Pogba does is breaking news."

            Pogba is the new Beckham. As a style icon, at least.

            And in today's game, players know that can be every bit as important to their public image as the number of assists and goals they score. Players are as relevant as the fashion choices they make. Or as the fashion choices people like Alsanawi make for them.

            Beckham's haircuts and tattoos helped set him aside as an icon of his time, but with the rise of social media, the many, not the few, appear similarly obsessed with their image.

            "There's something about Pogba," says Finlay Renwick, deputy style editor for Esquire magazine in London. "He's outlandish but definitely very cool."

            His risky fashion sense has become as famous as his ability. The France international has had more than 20 eccentric hairstyles since moving to Old Trafford in an £89 million transfer in 2016. His appeal as a role model was underlined last year as his eponymous PP clothing range for Adidas nearly sold out in one day.

            Fashion game aside, Pogba isn't having the best season of his career. So when he joined up with France team-mates recently sporting an outlandish Super Saiyan Blue hairstyle, the general reaction was that perhaps he should worry less about how he looks and more about improving his performances.

            But as Alsanawi explained, it's not that simple. Fashion does matter.

            "Football is everything to Pogba. I know that," says Alsanawi, who styles Pogba as well as other top players across Europe. "Because he has a bad game, that means he can't look good? I don't think so.

            "I have spoken to a lot of players about this issue, and they all told me the same thing: Having a good haircut gives you confidence.

            "Let's look at it a different way: If you go to a nightclub and want to chat to a girl, you won't do it if you're not feeling confident. It's the same in any part of life. So, when you step on a football pitch, if you look good, you will naturally feel better about everything you do on that pitch. It's as simple as that. Having a good haircut is like buying Gucci or Louis Vuitton. It's part of who you are."

            Alsanawi has become the game's trim king at a time when a player's hairstyle has become as important as his boots.

            Today's footballers want to stay relevant and cool in a game that is more high-profile than ever, largely thanks to the rise of platforms like Instagram. An on-point barber helps them achieve that.

            "Due to their platform and the hero worship that surrounds them, footballers have a propensity for 'peacock' style, so to speak," Renwick says. "It is something that seems to have increased with the rise of social media and the constant monitoring and scrutiny of the modern player."


            Alsanawi, of A Star Barbers in Chessington, a suburb half an hour from London, found his way into the game as Chelsea's first-team barber at their Cobham training ground, and his clientele today remains impressive. He usually visits players at home or in a team hotel. Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Borussia Dortmund's Michy Batshuayi and Manchester City star Benjamin Mendy are a few of the elite names who sit in his chair.

            "Social media has changed the game both for the barbers and celebrities," he says. "It's interesting that people can see my pictures with Pogba and see a normal bloke standing with a superstar."

            Pogba has been taking care of his hair for years, but other big names are new to the style scene. Part of Alsanawi's role is to act as an image consultant—even when a player does not seem interested.

            "I forced Eden Hazard to have a skin fade," he laughs. "He didn't want it, kept saying he was a family guy. But I had a vision for him, and it took about 18 months to persuade him to go with it.

            "Now he has a skin fade, line in his eyebrow, a shape up and a beard! He has an image and a look people actually now copy. I literally have people asking for Eden Hazard's haircut…but before this, he never really had a look he was known for."

            Danny Rossetter is a tattooist at Studio Voltage in Horley, Surrey, but will soon be joining Ahmed as a new branch of A Star.

            Most of his clients in the football world play at Chelsea and Brighton & Hove Albion, and he feels the tattoo industry is experiencing a boom.

            "Over the last five to eight years, it has picked up in football," he admits. "Obviously there was Beckham back in the 2000s, with his sleeves and back pieces by Louis Malloy up in Manchester. But recently it has really started to take off again.

            "At the moment, there are a few tattoos in football I really like. Leroy Sane has a great back piece of himself celebrating, Memphis Depay has a lion's head, and Andre Gray has a really cool piece made up of people like Muhammed Ali and Bob Marley.

            "British footballers seem to like a religious theme for some reason, whereas players from abroad tend to go for a more traditional look. I think a lot of it comes down to what the people around them have got and just following trends.

            "Players with families often get something reflecting their children, but the younger ones might not have that so just follow suit from others they have seen. Like most things, a lot of my work comes through word of mouth, but certainly more players seem to be getting tattoos now."

            It seems common that footballers have a pied-piper approach to many aspects of fashion. In their small training-ground communities, it is no surprise that it only takes one player to try a look that works and others suddenly follow.

            Clothing is also a big part of it.

            Sam Morgan is a personal shopper from north London who has become a major figure in the lives of players up and down the country. Top players earn seven-figure salaries and want to be seen in garments others simply can not get their hands on, so Morgan acts as their first port of call.

            "There are two main reasons footballers come to me for their clothes," Morgan explains. "Firstly I can source items that aren't available in the shops, and secondly I make the process hassle free for them.

            "Why would they want to go trawling around shops or the Internet when they can send me a message to sort it for them?"

            Morgan has helped make purchases for 250 players across every Premier League club over the past year and is in daily contact with stars over WhatsApp to help meet their needs.

            "Players tend to hear about me from someone else at the training ground and then get in touch," he explains. "Players tend not to just buy one thing at once, though. It's not unusual for them to spend £2,000 on four or five items.


            "Recently I sold a pair of shoes to one for £2,000, and someone else came to me with a £16,000 order for clothes. They pay by bank transfer. It's all very easy."

            Balenciaga, Fear of God, Amiri, Givenchy and Gucci are all in-demand brands at the moment, and Morgan uses contacts across the world to source and deliver items to a player's door.

            "Sometimes I deliver personally," he says. "Recently I was at the house of one player, and at 6 p.m. he asked if I could get a certain pair of shoes in a size nine. By 6.45 p.m., I had someone delivering them to the door! It's a fun job. I enjoy getting to know the players and it's great that so many trust me."

            It is one thing to look good in person, but being seen in the best cars, at the best holiday destinations, wearing the right watch and at the must-see events is vital, too.

            For all this and more, AC13 Premier and AC13 Lifestyle have become the go-to guys for footballers up and down the country.

            Marlon Harewood, the former West Ham United striker, heads the company, flanked by Riccardo Leighton and Andy Cole. Their main focus is helping to deliver bespoke cars for their clients—who range from England's Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy to Birmingham City's Che Adams and Arsenal women's captain Alex Scott.

            An in-vogue motor for elite stars right now is the Mercedes V-Class, with mod-cons such as Wi-Fi, TV, gaming system, reclining seats and starlight roof.

            "People always expect top players to move clubs and then buy a fancy house, but that is not so much the case anymore," explains Leighton, who has a background working in concierge.

            "Like anyone else, they don't want to be ripped off or wasting money, and a lot of players are actually buying luxury cars now instead of moving.

            "We have one client who has a driver and each day travels to training from London to Manchester. His seat fully reclines, and he sleeps through the journey. That isn't ideal for everyone, but it works for him. I know there are other players that do the same thing.

            "Some players don't just want them to sleep in, though. A lot like to have a starlight roof. Others like the back of the car to convert into an office so they can use laptops and make calls. Of course, there is often a Playstation or Xbox involved, too.

            "The benefit of using our company is that we can organise the whole purchase for them. We can buy the car and then add all the extras or they can buy the car and we will convert it. We are there to make life easier for them."

            So, what does an expert make of today's Premier League of fashion?

            "I think footballers are considered important in terms of influence and reach, but footballers are—at least in the fashion industry—often viewed through the prism of being magpies who buy the most expensive, most brazen item of clothing and disregard how it actually looks on them, which is fair enough really," Esquire's Renwick says.

            " I think a lot of them grow up in a bubble where their style is influenced by their peers, the other players, which means they're competing to be the boldest one in the room. The guy with the 'best' stuff. I think that can also explain the tattoos and mad haircuts: wanting to be noticed.

            "In terms of standout figures in the game, I think that, aside from the old David Beckham line, Hector Bellerin of Arsenal is at least trying some daring looks at the moment and obviously has a very keen interest and knowledge of fashion.

            "Other than that, I think Xabi Alonso and Andrea Pirlo—despite being retired—still have that suave, continental look that I think a lot of football fans aspire towards."

            "It's not outlandish, but I think most guys want to look good in a suit, which they definitely do."

Whether it's "peacock" or "continental" or just the right clothes, tat or car, the goal's the same: the right image. Today's footballer knows he can't score that with just his boot.

        text: """
            Cancer has become a tops along with cardiovascular disease as leading causes of death in industrialized countries. Many cases of cancer only get diagnosed after the tumour has developed extensively, decreasing chances of recovery. Cure rates for prostate cancer is 32%, and 11% for colon cancer. Ability to detect tumours early and reliably would save a significant amount of lives and decreases need for lengthy, stressful, expensive treatments.
            Researchers have presented a possible solution for early warning via a synthetic gene network which will recognize lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancer at early stages when the level of calcium within blood becomes elevated due to tumour development. As calcium levels exceed a threshold value over a period of time signal cascade is triggered, which initiates production of the body’s tanning pigment melanin within the synthetic genetically modified cells, which forms a brown mole visible to the naked eye, that appears before the cancer becomes detectable through current conventional diagnosis. Mole appearance does not mean the person is likely to die, rather it means a tumour is developing in very early stages to seek clarification and treatment.
            Calcium was used as indicator as it regulated strongly within the body. Bones serve as buffer which can balance concentration differences, when too much calcium is detected this may serve as a warning sign that one of the four cancers is present. Early detection greatly increases chances of survival and elimination. If breast cancer is detected early there is a 98% chance of recovery, if diagnosed too late sadly that number drops greatly to being only one in four having a good chance of recovery. Typically people don’t know and only go to see a doctor when the tumour begins to cause issues, which unfortunately is too late by that point most often.
            The synthetic early warning implant is primarily for self monitoring and is cost effective. An implant can also be used which develops a mark which is only visible under a red light which could be checked out by their doctor for those that may think the other method carries too much stress as an added advantage. Disadvantage would be that this implant service life is limited to about one year according to their studies, after which it must be inactivated and replaced. Biomedical tattoo is another concept is also a new finding that is also applicable to other gradually developing illness such as hormonal disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in which the team would replace the molecular sensor to measure biomarkers other than calcium.
The prototype early warning system has been functioning reliably during lab tests on model mouse and pig skin. It is noted that there still is a way to go before human testing can begin, sighting continued development and clinical trials are labor extensive and expensive, which the research group can not afford on their own, the team would like to promote translation of developments so one day they will lead to applicable products, estimating that it will take at least ten years of research and development to bring the cancer diagnostics implant to market maturity.

            Gathered around a white plastic table, four scientists surgically explored a quaking pile of mud, freshly scraped from the bottom of the ocean and spiked with twitching tentacles and antennae. In the persistent dusk of an Arctic October, illuminated only by the navigation lights of their ship, the scientists’ orange rubber jumpsuits looked like a collection of traffic cones, bright and reflective against the murky sky. With long tweezers, the researchers organized the mess before them into tidy piles of sponges, starfish, and squirts, delicately picking each out of the morass as if extracting a prized shrimp from a takeout carton of lo mein. I hopped back and forth behind them, trying to stay warm in the biting ocean air and out of range of any sludge flung from the work area. Even in the Arctic, mud is still mud—copious, dirty, and potentially filled with life.

            Traveling the world to see microbes, plants, and animals in oceans, grasslands, forests, deserts, the icy poles—and wherever else they may be.

            To the 24 scientists on board the Helmer Hanssen, a 209-foot, navy-blue-hulled fishing-boat-turned-research-vessel, the scene was deeply familiar. Most of the members of the team are based in Norway, at the University of Tromsø—the northernmost university in the world—where they are part of a lab called Marbio; the Helmer Hanssen is their home during annual, and sometimes biannual, trips in search of undiscovered organisms. The group is looking for compounds that have novel effects on other living substances, hoping that some of their finds will lead to new, lifesaving treatments for cancer and drug-resistant infections in humans. Their type of mission—traveling deep into rain forests, or to the top of the world, to look for rare, microscopic life—is called bioprospecting. The Helmer Hanssen had just embarked on its 14th bioprospecting trip in half as many years (the 13th was skipped superstitiously), and this time, I had been invited along on the voyage.

            Two days earlier, our expedition had departed from Longyearbyen, a utilitarian settlement on the island of Spitsbergen in the archipelago of Svalbard. Halfway between the Norwegian mainland and the North Pole, Svalbard is an Arctic outpost frequented mostly by fossil-fuel experts, adventure tourists, and scientists.


            For the first few days, we sailed among Svalbard’s fjords and islands, moving gradually north. Eventually, we would lose sight of land, becoming entirely surrounded by ocean and, later, by ice. Every day, and every mile, would bring us closer to what everyone on board called mørketiden, “the dark time,” the season when the highest reaches of the Arctic Circle receive no sunlight. Our goal was 82 degrees latitude—the farthest north the team had ever traveled.

            We would be at sea 12 days, and the work would be continuous: The Marbio team was divided into two watches that worked alternating six-hour shifts, collecting samples by scraping the ocean floor, trawling its waters, and picking its shores. Some of the scientists on board focused on compounds with antimicrobial properties; others were in the business of measuring chlorophyll and capturing microalgae. Four of us had never been on the Helmer Hanssen, but the rest of the scientists were used to the boat and the sea, and attuned to the whims of both. No matter his or her specialty or level of experience, a tolerance of both the work and the waiting was required to scout promise in a brooding sea.

            One night, as I sat in the ship’s instrument room with the trip’s bearded leader, Hans Christian Eilertsen, he acknowledged the tough odds of bioprospecting. “It’s very much like looking for a needle in a haystack,” he said with a comfortable chuckle.


            For Eilertsen and his colleagues, the gamble is hard to resist. Imagine a starfish the size of your thumbnail, its stubby arms curling skyward like a baby’s. Folded inside the little animal, underneath its knobbly pink skin, are ribbons of DNA and enzymes, millions of years of information stored 15,000 feet below the surface of the Arctic Ocean. For humans, these microscopic structures might be lifesaving—or they might mean nothing at all. The only way to find out is to find the starfish.

            For thousands of years, nature has provided humans with medicine. The Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian text from 1550 b.c., recommended plants, minerals, and other natural products for the relief of everything from urinary-tract infections to wrinkles. At least some of these ancient prescriptions were effective: Honey, recommended for infected wounds, does have antibiotic properties, and coriander, recommended for pain, is a mild analgesic. You probably have at least one plant-based drug in your medicine cabinet. Aspirin was originally made from the bark and leaves of the white willow tree. Taxol, a common anticancer drug, comes from the Pacific yew tree. And nearly a century ago, penicillin was isolated from a species of mold that sprung up, uninvited, in a London professor’s petri dish.

            Sixty percent of the drugs we take today were developed from natural products, and most of those products have terrestrial sources. Currently, only seven FDA-approved pharmaceuticals in clinical use have marine sources, compared to hundreds of land-based drugs. And while scientists have isolated more than 30,000 unique organic compounds from marine organisms, they believe there are hundreds of thousands more to be found.


            But reaching the bottom of the ocean is a much more labor- and technology-intensive operation than, say, trekking into a rain forest in Costa Rica. Only with the advent of scuba technology in the 1950s were humans able to spend sustained time foraging underwater. And while researchers might need only 50 grams of sea sponge for initial product testing, any commercial product requires far more raw material—and consequently far more time, risk, and cost.

            Marbio is one of several international lab groups to take to the high seas, and often these groups pool both their financial resources and their search efforts. Most recently, Marbio took part in PharmaSea, an EU-funded, international consortium of 24 different partners, that collaborated in a search of both warm and cold oceans.

            Marbio, however, is a leader among teams working regularly in the Arctic. To survive in extreme conditions, many Arctic organisms have evolved unique and unusually potent chemical defenses, so in theory, products derived from cold-water organisms could be more effective than those from warmer regions. But because human bioprospectors in the Arctic must contend with extreme conditions, too, the search for microscopic life in our cold oceans is just getting started.

            ***

            Svalbard has a total landmass about the size of West Virginia, but in 2017, its human population was a mere 2,210. Beginning in the 1600s, the largest island, Spitsbergen, served as a walrus-hunting and whaling hub for the English, Dutch, and French, and later was sparsely populated by Russian coal miners. During the Helmer Hanssen’s journey through the archipelago, we encountered the flotsam and jetsam of human activity: abandoned outposts and weather stations, the occasional brick—bright as a flare against the beige scenery—and, of course, lots and lots of plastic. But save for the persistent seabirds, we were completely alone.

            On the voyage’s first full day, Eilertsen selected a Ph.D. student named Teppo Rämä and I for a shore-picking voyage. Rämä’s work focuses on the antibiotic potential of fungi, and we would be scavenging the icy beach at the base of the island’s fjords in search of it. Mummified in my heavy, waterproof, yellow-and-blue Arctic suit, I joined Eilertsen, Rämä and a member of the ship’s crew in an outboard-powered skiff. As we ripped toward shore, a walrus surfaced near our little inflatable dinghy, and I was startled by the size and proximity of its huge, tusked head, a boulder rising from the water.

            When we reached land, I stumbled while dismounting from the skiff, and my phone fell from my pocket into the cold brine of the ocean, never to be seen again. We had already traveled above the horizon of the satellites that serve mainland Europe, so on the boat cell service was intermittent, announced only by the sudden pings of a slew of missed texts. Now, without even that tenuous link to civilization, I’d have to fully embrace the solitude of the Arctic.

            Ashore, Eilertsen and Rämä took off in different directions while I stayed near the armed crewman, mindful of the very real possibility of a polar-bear encounter. Though it was just after lunch, dusk had already fallen. We worked under the pink sky, crouching among frosted rocks and the logs washed up from Siberia, frozen but still fecund. Using his serrated paring knife, Rämä harvested a small, square sample from one of the beached logs, secured it in a Ziploc baggie, and moved down the frost-speckled beach.


            To travel so far, and into such inhospitable territory, on such slim hopes may seem foolish, but the need for new drugs, and particularly new antibiotics, is pressing. One recent study predicted that by 2050, if nothing is done to combat the global overuse of antibiotics and the resulting rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, infections will kill more people per year than cancer. The implications—for human life expectancy and for society as a whole—are so grim that experts refer to this future reckoning as “antibiotic winter.”

            On the silent Svalbard coast, Rämä and Eilertsen traipsed on, filling their baggies with algae scraped from logs and rocks. The beach was scattered with shin-high icebergs laced with holes; jellyfish lay on the sand like so many magenta lily pads. Later, I would ask Eilertsen how he and Rämä knew where to look, and exactly what they were looking for. Eilertsen tried to explain their methods, but acknowledged that they were heavily influenced by circumstances and their inability to control them. “Teppo, he’s looking for fungi on old driftwood, and it’s peculiar,” he said making a that crazy kid face. “But I mean, he could find gold. Who knows?”

            Onboard the Helmer Hanssen, the researchers rotated between sampling the ocean and sampling the food. Breakfast was an array of porridges and eggs, meats and cheeses, laid out like an unusually wholesome Vegas buffet. Lunch tended to be warm, hearty, and stew-like, a midday reward for engaging with the elements. By dinnertime, a feast even by land standards, I could usually manage only a small serving of lutefisk and whale meatballs before rolling off to sleep.

            After following the west coast of Svalbard for several days, we turned northwest toward Greenland and the open sea, heading for the Yermak Plateau. Though the Arctic Ocean is the world’s smallest, its depth can reach nearly 18,000 feet—more than three miles—in parts of the Arctic Circle, and a plateau on the ocean floor is a rare sampling opportunity. By the time we reached Yermak, the crew’s daily routine was well established: At 9 a.m., after breakfast, the entire group gathered in the instrument room, a communal space where a wall of monitors displayed various updates about the voyage, including a live video feed from the shelter deck where the hauls of ocean mud were raised. During the meeting, Eilertsen, outfitted in his cruise uniform—a black button-up shirt tucked into black chinos, with a baby-blue comb in his back pocket—went over the day’s schedule.

            The scuba divers, one each from Greenland, Norway, and Italy, had arguably the hardest jobs on the ship. Though the team used an underwater drone for initial surveys, retrieving specimens required humans, and most days the three men made multiple dives. Every few hours, the crew would also lower a dragging device—part bucket, part claw—from the back of the ship, dredge up a wheelbarrow’s worth of mud, and deliver it to the white plastic table and a group of waiting scientists.

            After the morning briefing, half of the crew members returned to their bunks for rest while the rest began a six-hour shift of sampling. At 2 p.m., the watches switched. The Helmer Hanssen had six decks, with bunks scattered among them. My bunk, located in the ship’s bow a floor above on the shelter deck, was a windowless nook with an enclosed bunk bed, a small locker and a plush chair with a foot-long table protruding from one wall. The mess, on the ship’s fourth floor or topgallant deck, was cozy and couch-lined, and every night after dinner, the scientists—one shift putting off going to bed, the other putting off starting to work—would allow themselves an interlude of tea drinking, knitting, and chitchat. During occasional spells of satellite service, we would watch Norwegian prime-time shows like Farmen, a reality show in which contestants are forced to live on a farm with no electricity or running water and compete in games like axe throwing.


            The bridge, a quiet, carpeted room ringed with windows, was a refuge from the engine noise and industrial chill that permeated the rest of the ship. It had books and binoculars, and its quiet was only occasionally broken by the crackle of the captain’s radio. The room was the perfect place for staring—by day into the infinite water, dotted with schools of dolphins and spouts of whales, and by night at the northern lights, whose vibrating glow consumed the sky. From the bridge, it was clear that our tiny vessel floated on an enormous ocean, and that the world wasn’t ours. Instead, we were just a few dozen creatures cast among countless others.

            ***

            Despite the depth and breadth of human ingenuity—our ability to accelerate particles, send men to the moon and rovers to Mars, produce lifesaving drugs, watch American Ninja Warrior via satellite TV on a boat within the Arctic Circle—it’s still difficult for us to outfox bacteria, which can duck, evade, and even fight back against our antibiotic attacks.

            One way to outwit bacteria is to sneak up on them incognito, disguising an existing antibiotic by slightly changing its structure. This technique is relatively inexpensive, but risks creating a drug that the target bacteria are already somewhat familiar with, increasing the likelihood of resistance. Another method involves finding completely novel molecules and turning them into drugs unfamiliar to at least some dangerous bacteria. But this practice, as the members of Marbio well know, can be dramatically more difficult. As Jeanette Andersen, the head of Marbio, told me, “you don’t know what you’re looking for.”

            The search for the unknown takes lots of time and lots of money: The cost of an average day aboard the Helmer Hanssen is about 200,000 Norwegian kroner, or $25,500. Funding comes into the Marbio lab in a variety of ways, including from the university, the Norwegian government, commercial partners and external grants. And trips must be made with regularity, as even frozen samples can degrade in the laboratory.

            After the Helmer Hanssen had returned to port, I visited the Marbio lab in Tromsø, where the team members were beginning to process the hundreds of samples from the trip. They screened each sample to determine its structural information, elemental composition and biological activity, then checked their data against international databases. Had they found a known compound? If so, they returned to their collection of new samples. Had they found a known compound with novel activity? If so, they studied it more closely. Had they found a novel compound with novel bioactivity? If so, their work had only begun. Though years of trial and error stood between the researchers and a new drug, there seemed to be no misgivings about the worthiness of the work.

            Since 2007, the Marbio team, participating in a project called MabCent, has spent more than a full year at sea and sampled from over 1,000 different locations around the Svalbard archipelago. They have collected 1,200 different species of invertebrates and hundreds of species of microalgae, totaling more than 3,000 pounds of organisms. And while the work has not yet led to any commercially available drugs, the team has made promising finds, such as a molecule, isolated from a sponge, that has strong antioxidant activity relevant to cancer and diabetes. So strong, in fact, that its effects are now being tested in mouse studies. And gradually, Marbio’s work is helping to narrow its search: Their sample analysis suggests, for example, that Arctic invertebrates have more potential for anticancer compounds, and that fungi are more likely to yield antibiotics.


            Bringing a new drug to market—discovering a new compound on land or sea and developing it into a pill ready to swallow—costs, on average, more than $2.5 billion, and takes about 10 years. Even given enough money and time, the odds of success are long: Of the drugs being developed worldwide that make it to clinical testing, only about 12 percent are approved for commercial sale. Antibiotics, which don’t command high prices and can be rendered useless by fast-evolving bacteria, are risky investments for drug manufacturers, who prefer to invest in the research and development of lifestyle drugs. A diabetes medication, meant to be taken every day for the rest of one’s life, is more profitable than an antibiotic created to be taken only in dire situations.

            As I walked down one of the lab’s sterile hallways with Andersen, she acknowledged that new drugs are by no means a complete solution to the antibiotic crisis. “I think it would be very naïve to think that we will solve everything by finding a new antibiotic, because we know that it will eventually develop resistance for that molecule,” Andersen said soberly. “But I think we should find new things, because there should be things in development that could be used as a last resort.”

            The voyage itself was full of improvisation: The Helmer Hanssen was forced to change course when conditions were unnavigable, and to move on when samples yielded nothing new or useful. The main purpose of our trip was to take advantage of a waning summer thaw to get farther north than typically possible, but when we reached 81.5 degrees latitude, less than 1 degree short of our objective, the team discovered that high winds had packed swirling pancakes of ice into a giant, nearly unbroken sheet. We stood on the deck in the purple Arctic glow, gazing out at an eerily wind-pocked ice field that disappeared into the sky at the horizon in a jewel-toned wash of light.

            In order to sample the ocean, the scientists would have to stand on the ice, which wobbled dangerously in the waves. I watched from the deck as the researchers descended to the ice via a rickety gangplank, using shovels to keep their balance and ladders to traverse the shifting floes.

            When they reached a fissure, some researchers lay on their bellies, scraping at the ice with small knives, while others jabbed at it with shovels, ad-libbing in the chaotic conditions. After about 45 minutes, the group returned with buckets and baggies of shaved ice, ready to be tossed into the ship’s walk-in lab freezer for preservation. But our stay so far north would be short-lived. The crew had decided that the ice would soon envelop the boat, making it impossible to retreat to open water. That night, the Helmer Hanssen turned southward, and Eilertsen began to plot a new course.

            Even though the team had not reached 82 degrees, no one seemed disappointed. The hit-or-miss nature of bioprospecting, and the rarity of a bonanza, generally tempered expectations.

            One night, over after-dinner cups of tea during our three-day straight shot across the open Arctic Ocean back to the Norwegian mainland, I asked Klara Stensvåg, a microbiologist, whether the trip had been a success.

            Shocked by the suggestion that it had not, Stensvåg folded over her phone’s pink leather cover and began scrolling through her pictures, pausing at an image of an orange ball covered in pimples. “This,” she said, gesturing at the blob. “We had wanted it for a couple of years and at Bjørnøya, we got it.” It was a sea squirt called Synoicum pulmonaria, known for its bioactivity against bacteria, and it had been on Stensvåg’s wish list for a long time. The team had only collected one on this voyage, but as Stevnsvåg said, “Even one is good.”


            Bjørnøya—“Bear Island”—halfway between Svalbard and mainland Norway, had not been on the original itinerary; only because of the unforeseen ice conditions had the team decided to make a stop. Stensvåg gazed at the image on her phone, zooming in on it, marveling at her luck. “It felt like an orange,” she said, recalling the moment when the divers, back from another chilly mission, presented her with the little ball.

            Any discovery in the ocean, I was learning, required both relentlessness and luck. At one point during one of our evening conversations in the instrument room, Eilertsen confessed, “To be honest, a full cruise can be a waste—but we don’t know that beforehand, so we must continue.” Though always useful in terms of gathering samples, not every trip yielded something novel. “It’s like a lottery ticket you must buy again and again.”

            ***

            Earlier in the trip, about a week after leaving Longyearbyen, we visited an island named Moffen, off the northwest tip of Svalbard. Flat and shaped like a corona, with a lagoon at its center, Moffen felt like a floating beach, barely breaking the surface of the ocean. In the 1700s, this particular island was a center of walrus slaughtering; by the middle of the 20th century, the walrus population around Svalbard was nearly extinct. In 1983, the Norwegian government protected the island as a sanctuary so that the walrus population could reestablish itself.


            Eilertsen insisted we all get off the boat and go ashore. He argued that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and besides, we needed the exercise. Once all 24 of us had shuttled to Moffen in the skiff, we scattered, as we were apt to do whenever released from the confines of the Helmer Hanssen. Pairs of scientists turned over rocks, or squatted and examined whale vertebrae the size of Frisbees. A small group of Ph.D. students inspected the frozen body of a dead duck. In the distance, I spotted two seesawing on one of the washed-up Siberian logs. Eilertsen urged us to hurry, which was difficult given that we were wearing our cumbersome survival suits, and full of another enormous Norwegian lunch. The wind gusted by like a passing train, eliminating conversation. We reached a field of walrus bones, the slaughtering ground from generations before. The bones were covered in soft algae, the first green I had seen in days.

“There’s something special about the ice,” one of the Ph.D. students had said to me early in the voyage. “The first time I came up here, I couldn’t sleep. I just stared at the ice.” Everyone who has traveled above 80 degrees latitude seems similarly enchanted. For many, the vast emptiness of the Arctic feels full of potential—of organisms still unknown, of limits not yet reached. That afternoon on Moffen, a place home to wild animals, I understood the spell. Our trip was only halfway over, but already I was missing the Arctic Ocean. The sea belongs to the creatures that swim beneath its surface, not the ones who temporarily float on top of it. But I knew there would be days in the future when I would wish for an excuse to return, to recapture that feeling of frozen expanse, of treasures yet to be found.
